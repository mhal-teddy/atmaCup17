0,25,3-season skirt!,"Adorable, well-made skirt! lined and very slimming. i had to size up b/c it runs a bit snug around the waist. however, it's worth it b/c this will match many long and short sleeve tops!",5,1,4
0,39,Very cute,Love the asymmetrical hem. waist fit snugly as in perfectly. it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well. a little stiff in the fabric. classic colors but decided not to keep only because i didn't feel like we could wear it all year round.  can't petite or 0p was great (115 lbs),5,1,0
0,42,Beautiful! fruns small for typical retailer sizing,"I love this skirt! i wasn't sure about the mix of the back pattern with the front but it works! it is great for work at a less conservative place and for dinners out too! the quality is great - the skirt is a fine silk, ant it is lined, so you don't need a slip. i think it fits perfectly for my body type, and while it runs big compared to typical retailer sizing, it is true to size compared to other stores in the petite sizes anyway. i am normally a 0 petite, 5'2"", 104, waist 24.5"", hips 34",5,1,5
0,45,,"I was really pleased with this skirt. the lightness of the fabric is nice and the colors matched the photos. i was initially concerned that it might be stiff and uncomfortable, but it feels like it has a bit of stretch and offers some good movement. sometimes retailer skirts seem to run small to me, but this fit perfectly in my regularl size.",5,1,9
0,57,"Unique, pretty asymmetric skirt","I saw this skirt in retailer several months ago and while it caught my eye, it was pricey. so i waited until it went on sale and pounced.  unfortunately i ordered a size 6 which is enroute.   i happened to stop by our local store today and decided to try on the 6 and ended up getting a size 4.  so i'll have to return the size 6 when it arrives.  i think it runs tts. i've lost alot of weight recently.

0,62,Beautiful day to evening skirt,"A lovely skirt and i'm so glad i found it before the medium sold out! having said that, i expected the medium to run small and that i'd have to squeeze into it but having tried it on this evening it's not the case at all. i nice fit. i might even have fitted into a small, which i think is the only size remaining. the skirt is very spain inspired. very flamenco! i love it! i will say that you'd need a bit of height to wear this skirt due to the length at the back. i'm 5'6"" which is tall enough fo",4,1,0
0,73,Too small,I usually wear a 6 and ordered two other skirts at the same time. the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size 2. very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it.,2,0,7
1,26,Love it so much!,"This jumpsuit is so, so cute. i tried it on in an xs in store but needed a petite. i ordered the xsp online, received it, but honestly it's still a little big. the xxsp is sold out, but i love the piece so much i think i'm going to have it taken in. trust me, it's just as cute as it looks, if not cuter!",4,1,0
1,30,Comfy but...,"The top is huge! i wear an xs and am not the bustiest of women, but the top part of this romper felt like it belonged on a medium or large, even though the bottoms and waist fit perfectly. i was really disappointed, as i loved it in every other way.",3,1,0

1,37,Nice romper,"This is adorable! i got it to wear on the plane for an upcoming vacation. this is definitely tts. i am normally a medium and got the medium. i am long wasted and this fit just fine. looks like it does on the model.
the material is super soft too. it is also easy to get on and off which is sometimes difficult with rompers.
plan on wearing it with gladiator sandals and a jean jacket.",5,1,9
1,38,Comfortable!,This jumpsuit is so so comfy i can't wait to wear it! def runs on the large size.,5,1,0
1,47,Not for the tall...,"This is a super cute romper--very casual, very comfortable. i feel it runs a bit big because i tried on an xs (i'm usually a small 4-6). it fit perfectly except for the inseam on the legs. i am 5' 8.5"" tall but mostly legs (as opposed to being long waisted). i wear a 33"" inseam with flats. if the bottom of the legs were not elasticized, i could have just gone with a cropped look or rolled them, etc. but the elastic was digging into my calves after just five minutes. i think it might be very unco",4,1,1

2,25,"Love, love, but way too big!","I so wanted to keep this, but the xs was even too big. i usually take an xs/s petite and thought i could get away with the xs of this. it is just too big. so sad to be returning it, wish it came in an xxs or petite.",4,1,4
2,26,Looks good but for specific sizes,"I am curvy and this top, while stylish and i love the pockets, just didn't do it for me. it made my shoulders look wider than they are, which is a big no no. it would probably look better on someone with smaller shoulders or slimmer. the wool was also a tad itchy - not too itchy, just a bit. in general i don't wear wool without cashmere, i also don't wear non-italian wool because it is a bit rough and my skin reacts to it. so i stick to wool cashmere blend or loro piana soft wool. this sweater s",3,0,1
2,33,Beautiful piece; runs large!,This jacket is beautiful and easily dresses an outfit up and can just as easily be dressed down and worn casually. i consistently wear a size 8/10/m and have this piece in xs. the reviews do not lie - size down!,5,1,0
2,35,"Well made, but doesn't always like to stay put","This is well made and beautiful, but it sometimes slides off so i feel like i'm adjusting it somewhat regularly.",4,1,1
2,38,Amazing find!,"I can?t describe my love for this sweater! simple, to go outfit paired with jeans and boots, it?s an easy go-to sweater in a pinch on a cold day. i have sensitive skin, so i wore a tank underneath and was fine. loved getting this sweater with the extra 40% sale price! i purchased the medium (2) and it was tts.",5,1,0
2,41,Best suited as a beach cover-up,"I am tall and typically wear a size 10/12, so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted. but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a cover-up than a tunic. it fits like a poncho. with my arms at my sides, it fit me similar to the model picture. but if i lift my arms (to use them), then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me. the reason for that is that it doesn't really have sleeves - it's more like hol",3,1,3

2,46,Ribbed lace hem pullover,"The front and back of this square sweater are the same, and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it's on backwards.the lace would be nice, but it's itchy. and the sweater is cropped, so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body. the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted, but the body shape is bulky. just couldn't get it to work.",3,0,10
2,48,Very pretty but very itchy,"Like the first reviewer, i love the color and look, and agree that it is much longer and wider than it looks in the photo. i am 5'3"" 116lb and ordered a small. i was planning to wear it tucked into palazzo pants as the model seems to have done, but they must have used some other way to gather up the sweater in back because there is no way such volumes of material can be tucked into anything. and the metallic threads are itchy, so i had to finally layer a full sleeve tee under it to be able to st",3,1,1
2,53,Unique,"This sweater is very comfortable and soft. unlike other reviewer, i did not find the lace to be itchy. i'm 5'4"", usually size 6; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel. this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted. it's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy. not sure how it's going to handle the wash.",4,1,0
2,54,Adorable but boxy,"Really liked the color but the style was too cropped and boxy for me. this sweater was short, wide and unflattering. however, i like this designer so i ordered another style with a different silhouette.",4,1,0
2,54,Oversized and itchy,The small is huge on me and the sweater is very itchy. cute idea but not for me. i will return it.,3,0,0
2,54,Unique neckline and swingy shape merino knit,"The neckline is beautiful, whether pulled forward or slipping back. the pure merino knit is very fine with the two front panels cut on the bias. raglan sleeves with high armholes. it is a tiny bit itchy, and normally i'm not too sensitive, but that may improve with a handwash in eucalan or something similar.

2,56,Not what i expected,The description doesn't indicate the metallic thread throughout the design. you cannot tell from the pix either. it's also a really strange design with the arm holes being almost the entire length of the sweater. can't decide if i want to keep it or return it.,3,1,3
2,60,Wear it and receive lots of compliments.,I wore it belted with a close fitting cami beneath because the sweater is open down both sides. be creative and wear it different ways.,5,1,1
2,62,Wonderful!,I am so surprised this was not styled properly in the photo! if worn the way it should be worn it would have sold out before going on sale. yes it is open down each side but you need to slide a belt inside the back so the back is left full and bring the belt out into the front on sides cinching in the front...making this a dramaticly gorgeous piece! i love it and will wear it with my leather jeans to pencil skirt. i am a personal stylist and designer and if you are thinking about this piece jump,5,1,3
2,74,Tunic,This top is well made and would be cute but huge. this top has no shape and is way big. back this goes.j,2,0,6
2,75,Dissapointed,"I love the ethnic colors & the creative woven design of this garment. that's what attracted me in the first place. however, some of the metallic threads had snagged & i thought the loose weave & acrylic yarns would lead to more snags & it would eventually stretch out of shape. also, it's very big. too bad it doesn't come smaller. in the online picture, it must have been gathered & clipped behind the model because it really doesn't fit close like that & the long armholes are not visible online as",2,0,1
3,19,,This dress is so pretty!! the second i saw it i knew i had to have it. make sure to get a smaller size because it can be a little big towards the waist as a result of the dress' design.,4,1,0
3,25,So beautiful!,"This dress is just absolutely adorable! you can dress it up and wear it to a wedding, or you can dress it down and slip on a pair of sandals and use it as a casual summer dress! this dress does run a tad bit large - i'm usually a size 4 but the size 4 was slightly too big for me. best purchase yet!",5,1,2
3,26,Beautiful and unique dress,I purchased this dress for my bridal shower and it was perfect! the details on it are amazing-delicate and lovely! i am 5'11'' and it hit just above my ankles which i loved because i could show off my shoes!,5,1,0
3,28,,"I was looking for a dress for my engagement pictures and once i saw this dress i knew it was the one! i ordered the white in a small (size 2) i am 5'4 130lbs. it fits perfect and the length is just right. some reviews said it's boxy and has too much flow to it but if you have the right size it won't be an issue! yes, it's a lace dress so it's going to be delicate and you'll need to handle with care. but it's worth it, absolutely stunning!",5,1,1
3,31,High quality one of a kind piece,"This dress had my attention immediately online, but in person it was even prettier. i would not say the colors are very ""pink"" as the color selection indicates, rather browns (with possible pink undertones) and yellows, and even a splash of dark green in the print here and there. there isn't a ton of give or stretch to the fabric so a larger chest may need to size up. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the size 4 fit just right (though i don't have a ton of extra room in the chest",5,1,2
3,31,Pretty but....,"The lace and fit were good. but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowy-ish the dress is. it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something. and i hated the ""outside"" middle material, hated it. it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace. maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece.",2,0,6

3,34,Beautiful dress!,"I have had my eye on this dress since the spring (in yellow), but it sold out quickly. i jumped on this dress as soon as i saw it come out in different colors this fall! i purchased the peach color and it is really lovely. i will be wearing this dress for family photos. the lace and the details are so very pretty! i am usually a size 0 or 2, and purchased in size 2 since there is no stretch to it. it is a beautiful dress and i highly recommend it! wish it came in white!",5,1,0
3,34,Cute but not worth the price,"Cute dress, runs small, especially in the sleeves and chest (i usually wear a 0 and purchased a 2). the outer layer is very sheer and while the print and shape are cute, the quality could be better, especially for the price.",4,1,0
3,34,Gorgeous dress,"This dress is gorgeous! the color is perfect for spring/summer. the dress does run wide/loose. i read reviews before ordering and i am glad that i did. i am usually a petite size, but the reviews recommended going with the regular due to length and the design at the bottom (and wanting to be able to bend over comfortably). i am 5'2 and about 116lbs. i ordered the 2 regular and it worked well. i received many compliments!",5,1,1
3,34,Lovely dress if you are small chested,"I fell in love with this dress online. i listened to the reviews and ordered a size up. i got it in the mail and couldn't wait to try it on! i was sad that to find, that while it was tight across the chest and the keyhole in the back seemed to pull, it was really large in the body. in addition, while the lace is beautiful it is very fragile. i still think this is a great dress but definitely for someone who is small chested. for reference i am a 32dd and size 2-4 and i ordered a medium.",3,1,0
3,34,Pretty details,"I got this in blush pink and the details are very pretty. the dress is wide, might have a tailor bring it in on the sides, but its very comfortable and i like that it covers my arms a bit, but still keeps you cool.",4,1,0
3,34,The dream dress!,I just discovered this dress a few days ago and it's simply dreamy!! i'd been searching for the perfect summer dress to wear to a wedding in june but had been highly disappointed in the selection of pastel colors from other shops. this dress is the perfect summer shade and will be perfect for the texas heat in june! i absolutely love how it flows and is elegant yet modest. the lace cut-outs are gorgeous!,5,1,3

3,35,Love this dress!,"I am 5ft 8in and about 140lbs-athletic busty build. i normally wear a size 4-6. i ordered this dress in white in a size 6 and couldn't be more pleased! i actually hopped online today to try to order another in the lilac but they are unfortunately sold out. this dress is exactly as pictured-the upper back is fitted, keeping it from going out too much and looking like a straight up tent. i adore it and hope that they will re-stock it!",5,1,0

3,37,"Great concept, poor execution","I really like this dress/shirt. it's great for layering, super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year's pregnancy weight gain. i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots.

unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size. this may sound weird but i've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward didn't change between the two sizes. i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back.",2,0,0

3,38,Beautiful,This dress is beautiful just like the picture. it fits true to size and is quite comfortable considering it is on the delicate side. definitely recommend this one!,5,1,0
3,38,Better for smaller chest,"Tried this dress on in the store and could barely button at my chest but the waist and length were perfect. ordered a size up and two sizes up online. went with the two sizes up because it did not pull as bad across the chest, though now it's a bit ""blousey"" around the waste. fabric is a little thin. similar to other reviews the slip is a little weird/wonky. i'm keeping it because i like the idea of the dress but i'm not sure about the lifespan with how gauzy the material is.",4,1,2
3,38,"Fun, flirty but snug up top","I'm keeping this cute and fun dress but i agree that the top is tricky if you have a larger bust or shoulders. i got my tts 6 and am a 32dd with broad shoulders and can wear it but it's snug. the top would probably look better in an 8 but there's so much volume below, i kept the 6. i'm 5'7"" and thought it was short but just fine for anything other than a professional setting. i have toddlers, so not the best dress for bending over, but fun for when i'm out and about on my own.

big compliments",4,1,1
3,38,So cute but tight!,"I wanted to love this dress so much and am so sad - it just didn't work for me. i am 5'2"", 138 pounds (still trying to lose that last 5-8 from my third daughter) and the chest/back of this dress was so tight i was afraid if i hugged someone it would split up the back. i am normally a size 6 and tried the 6 p, 8 p and 8 and they were all too tight in the chest/back. it sounds like this is common for these holding horses dresses. :(",3,0,3
3,39,Is this really black?,,5,1,0
3,39,My life is finally complete,"Now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done.  there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points:  great fit, flattering silhouette, comfortable fabric, shape enhancing cut, and the easiest casual style ever!  i got the 10p and my body is 5'3"" 140# 36dd",5,1,0
3,40,Sweet dress,This is an awesome go to for dressy or casual! wore it with booties for a dinner and flats for temple and was perfect for both! lace is a little delicate but worth the extra care!,5,1,0
3,41,Way too tight in the arms. don't size down!,"I just got this tunic last night and was excited to try it on. i could barely get it over my shoulders and once i did, it was immediately apparent that it was very tight under the arms and in the shoulders. i usually wear a 12 but listened to all the other reviewers and sized down to a 10. the 10 shoulder seams were significantly narrower than i would have expected. i don't think even a 12 would have been large enough in the shoulders.

very bummed, but yet i wasn't drawn to the colors in pers",3,1,0
3,42,Beautiful!,"Beautiful dress! excellent detail! loved everything about this dress except for the weight. this dress is very heavy which limits my wearing options in fl. given the fabric, this is a great special occasion dress.",4,1,6
3,42,Size down!,"This has a heftier fabric than seems to be in the picture online. i wish it were the same fabric as the fringed chambray dress. that, coupled with it being cut very generously, and the hip placement of the bulky pocket fabric, causes it to look quite thick and dumpy unless you pin your elbows in to show where your waist is.  i usually wear a 4-6, and bought the 2. i'm returning it for a 0 petite and see how that goes.  i love it, so i'm hoping that causes the fit to appear more as it does on the",4,1,0
3,43,Wish it was a different color,"I loved this dress when it came out this summer but it quickly became impossible to get. i snagged up this one as quickly as i could when it came out. i don't really love any of the fall colors it was offered in, but for this one - i would say it is much more rust and less orange in person.",4,1,0
3,44,Great dress,"I bought this dress after i had overnighted a different one and it wasn't going to be delivered on time. i'm so happy that i bought this dress. its so comfortable and easy to wear. i got lots of compliments on it.
it runs very large though. i ended up with a size 6. i initially tried on the 10, as i have a larger chest. the 6 still had plenty of room.",5,1,7
3,48,"Unique style, with comfy fit","This dress definitely runs large, so i ordered it through my local store, in order to get a size that would fit. i ordered one size down, but could have gone down 2. i love the embroidered design. i just wore the dress to a slovak festival, yesterday, and it fit right in :-) very comfortable, and fun to wear.",5,1,0
3,49,Big wow factor,"I was uncertain about purchasing this dress. wow so glad that i did. i'm 5'5"" and 138lbs. i can wear a small or medium so i ordered both. the small was plenty big enough. wore it to a family event and received numerous compliments. so different from anything else and classy with the longer length. thanks for a great dress! i hope that it cleans well!",5,1,2
3,49,This dress is huge,"I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp, my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no",2,0,5
3,51,Shapeless tent,I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i couldn't try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i don't think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price.,1,0,2
3,52,Pretty in plaid,"Dress runs a little small in the arms but flows nicely on the body. see through and comes with slip but slip is stiff and doesn't give. was hard to get on so i wore my own slip. other that that, dress is feminine and looks great on!",4,1,0
3,54,Love it!,"This dress is gorgeous in person, soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets. it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing. i bought at size 6 which was two sizes smaller than my normal size 10 in retailer dresses. i have worn twice and each time 2 random strangers have complimented it. it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear. the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow. expensive maybe, but well worth it.",5,1,3
3,54,Sassy maxi,"I""m not crazy about maxi dresses so when i found this fun print with fringe-it spoke my language. love this dress. feel this dress will work with many seasons. dress falls nicely and feels comfortable. i was worried it would be too long but with a 2 inch heel-its perfect. have paired it with some red dangled earrings that spice it just right.",5,1,0
3,56,Great find.,"This dress has special written all over it. the poms at the hem and bodice, as well as the rows of black seed beads push are the kind of details that stand out. i like all the varying textures. it looks great with sandals or short boots. fits true to size. a nice sassy length.",5,1,0
3,62,Gorgeous but overpriced,"I saw this in stores and ran right up to it because of the gorgeous embroidery work and vivid colors - unfortunately those bright colors are totally washed out in the online model pics...barely recognizable! the fabric itself is super soft and not at all stiff, plus it has pockets! i can see this looking great with leggings and boots, but the sleeves flared a little too much which i think would add bulk under a cardigan, so it might not carry as far into cooler months as i would like. my usual s",4,1,35
3,62,Tricky but cute,"I was immediately drawn to this dress when i saw it in the store. i'm normally a size 2 but i feel like the size two was too constricting in the chest and arms, so found a size 4 to be just right. it's longer and a bit wider than the size 2 everywhere else, but given the design, i thought it was fine. the main thing to note is that the top is snug and has no give whatsoever. if you have a larger bust or broader shoulders, sizing up is a must. lengthwise, it fit me like it does on the model.

3,68,Runs really large,"I'm glad i red the reviews before ordering and sized down. for reference, i am 5'7"" and generally a size 8 or m in dresses. the small in this piece fits loosely in a flattering way, but a medium would have swallowed me. otherwise, it's a great, casual piece. the material is light and soft, and it's cute over leggings.",4,1,0

4,27,Great purchase,"I went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress, and i'm so glad i did. the fit was perfect. i'm always a little hesitant about long dresses since i'm 5'2"", but the petite length was perfect. the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable, but i feel elegant in it. i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month.",5,1,0
4,28,Beautiful color,I wanted to love this dress. i bought the cranberry color and it really is gorgeous. the cut was wrong for my body type. it is a bit roomier than expected. but i wear a size 36ddd so the seams on the chest hit at a very awkward spot. i'm sure it would look great on someone with a smaller chest,3,1,0
4,28,Runs very big!,"I was excited to see this dress as i'd bought the sparrow boiled wool sheath dress in xs last year and loved the fit. however, this dress does not fit the same way. the top fits fine, but the waist and the bottom are way too big. i laid it over my sparrow dress from last year, and the bottom is at least an inch wider (two inches, if you go by the total circumference). i'm planning to exchange for an xxs and see if that one fits better.",4,1,1
4,31,Not flattering on straight figures,"Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit, you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me, it may work better on curvier figures.",3,0,4
4,31,Odd shape.,"I agree with the review above regarding the sizing of the dress being large. i am a pear shape so i was worried the small would be tight in the hips however, the dress as a whole seemed large and not overly shapely. i'm 5'8"" but i also thought the dress was an inch or so shorter than i would prefer for a winter/fall dress. the dress is a very dark forest green (not black). see the photo for the shaping of the dress - it shoes that, due to the material, it oddly bulges in certain regions rather t",3,0,37
4,31,Undecided,"The dress is great for pear shapes. however, i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing. ordered a small (5'8"" 140#) and i still think it may be a bit big. the material is very comfortable, not too thick or thin. however, i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric. see the attached photo.",3,0,25
4,33,"Absolutely beautiful, great quality","I bought this for an event, and when it arrived, i realized it was probably too dressy for my event. there are some large sparkly clusters of ""stones"" that are beautiful, but do make the dress more cocktail attire than i needed. if i had something to wear it to, i would keep it in a heartbeat. the fit is flattering and the quality is reminiscent of old school retailer pieces. there are cups already in the bodice, which is a huge plus imo. it's unique and beautiful!",5,1,0
4,34,Beautiful!,"I bought this dress to wear to my graduation where i was receiving a degree in horticulture. i also just had a child a few weeks prior and was worried about sizing. the high waist worked well for the post pregnancy belly. i am 5'3"" and was typically around 130 lbs pre-pregnancy which was typically a 4 in dresses. i ordered a 6 petite in this dress and it was perfect! the only area that was sort of tight was the bosom but i am nursing so i expected as much. the petite length was perfect for my he",5,1,1

4,36,Great look,This dress in coral is a beautiful color and awesome material. only problem is it runs a little big- i am a pretty true to size small and should've ordered an xs- the hips are a little wide and v in the neck a little low. instead of sending back i just wore a camisole and leggings w ankle boots and it looked very cute regardless.,3,1,0
4,39,Nice dress but what's with the hips?,"So i now own three sparrow wool sweater dresses (shyle, bressay, this one). they all have the same problem...hips cut large/wide past the waist! everything from the waist up fits great. i'm not sure who they are using as a fit model, but she must be curvy in that j.lo way (which is nice but not my shape). i love the green color, the warmth, the neckline, and the easy fit. i will wear a coat to hide the body of the skirt. and do more squats",4,1,0
4,39,Still thinking,"As others have said, this dress does run large. i ordered the xxs petite, and ti isalmsot big on me (hips are wide, so at least, it is comfortable in width). material is a bit scratchier than i am used to s well.

color is great, and it looks nice when i see it on my stylist, who convinced me to hold on to it for a little... thinking about it.

my zipepr was also a little hard to work.

4,40,Lovely dress,"This is dress is great for an occasion - such as a wedding.

i wanted to keep this dress for such occasion - but there were 2 drawbacks. i ordered the dress online and when i opened the package, there it had some sort of oil/petroleum based product smell. the other drawback is the hips - it just flared out more than i wanted. i think that a belt would have solved that, but i usually don't find belts in my size.

as for the fit, it is true to size. i'm a true petite and the 00p fit great!",4,1,0
4,41,,I love this dress!!! this is perfect for ladies with curves. it does run a little large and i felt i could have worn both the small and the medium. i bought medium because it accentuated my curves without being too revealing. i bought the dark green which is a beautiful color and not see through at all...although i can guess the white might show a little but the white was not available in my store. this will be so perfect for the cold weather.,5,1,12

4,49,"Very cute, but...","This is a very cute and warm dress. it is flattering, yet appropriate for work. but i had to send it back for two reasons. the zipper didn't work well. it just wouldn't zip without someone helping me and even then it was very difficult to zip. perhaps it was just the zipper on my dress?

the neck felt like it was strangling me was the other reason i sent it back. if i am not comfortable i will not end up wearing it, so even though i loved the style of it the pragmatics were lacking.",4,0,1

4,72,The very good and the very bad,"First of all, the fabric's summery pattern of blossoms, honeybees and butterflies is beautiful and absolutely unique. i love it so much i wish i could afford to keep the dress as an art object. also, with one important exception, the dress is well made. the underslip is the right length and opacity. the dress is not transparent,
which is a big plus. there is a slight greenish cast to the background instead of the pure ivory shown
in the pictures. this makes the color a bit harder to wear. and",3,1,3
4,74,Comfortable and versatile,"I purchased this in grey and wine and both are wonderful. the boiled wool is light but warm and not itchy. fits nicely through the bodice and flares out to create a nice shape. the pockets are terrific and lay nice and flat. i'm short but the petite was well above my knee. i could have worn petite small just fine. it fit nicely in the bodice - the smaller size brought the seaming up a bit higher to form a more empire waist, but i chose the petite medium because i wanted it loose through the wais",5,1,1

too bulky, a problem if you wanted to eat something.
but the color looked yummy so i finally ordered it....
and i'm so pleased i did! 
the shape is actually easy to wear - it's not chopped. it drapes nicely over my hips and it isn't itchy.

more casually with jeans.",5,1,1

i wish they made this in petite as the xs is slightly big (i'm 5'3"" 106 lbs) but i kept it anyway since i'm both a little underweight right now and also since i was able to roll the top so that it was an appropriate length to wear with flats. 

i paired with a denim shirt- perfection.",5,1,0
6,36,Great maxi,I've been looking for a versatile maxi skirt all season. the pleats and layered look were a great effect to a really basic navy maxi skirt. the waist is elastic (great for after baby) and will look good with a shirt tucked in and belt. the only drawback is that it's a little too long and will drag on the ground if i wear flats (i'm 5'7''). soft material with some flowy movement when you walk.,4,1,2

6,39,Love it!,"I ordered the skirt on friday and it arrived on monday. my expectations were exceeded. the fabric is great quality and there are subtle flecks of gold throughout. the fabric is substantial but not stiff at all - for this type of skirt, you need a thicker fabric. i'm about 5'4"", 123lbs and i ordered a 2 regular. the fit - everything from the length to how it fell on the hips, is perfect. can't wait to wear this skirt!",5,1,0
6,39,Not exactly what i expected,The fabric is very thick and textured almost like upholstery and has no give to it.  the zipper is a little tricky to get all the way up because of the fabric thickness. i looks cute and holds its shape. it may run a touch small because of the fabric. the colors are great though and i really like it.,4,1,1

6,53,Fun skirt to wear instead of shorts,"This is very cute. it's lined, it's smocked. it's longer on me than the model in the picture. i was a bit concerned about the short length but the skirt actually came to just above my knees, which works well for me. it might run a tad big because it is a pull of skirt. i look forward to wearing this light weight skirt on hot days his summer!!",5,1,10

7,33,Good in theory but too large,"I typically wear a size 16/xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl. it's more of a t-shirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge. it's nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l, this would have looked like a maternity top on me.",2,0,0
7,33,Pretty but weird fit,"I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs, 32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.",2,0,0

7,34,Like wearing a beautiful painting,"The retailer by me actually had this and i had to try it on. my thoughts below:
___________
pros:
- well-constructed with lining underneath to avoid the need of a cami or tank. no see-through issues whatsoever.
- the fabric is great quality and looks nicely sewn. no fraying or strays seen on the 2 sizes i tried.
- there's a back zipper that goes from top to bottom at the back. unusual as i don't see why that's needed since you can just slip it over your head.
- front ""v slit"" isn't too low or reve",4,1,78

13,38,Amazing pants/leggings,"As stated in my review title, they're amazing! they're incredibly well made, have just the right amount of stretch, and are so flattering. i think the boot cut makes them look like pants rather than leggings. they can definitively be worn to work, or at least where i work, where the dress code is business casual. my only issue is the length, which being at 5'3 isn't surprising. they're about 3 inches too long. i'm a size 8-10 and got the large. i couldn't recommend these enough",5,1,0
13,39,Nope - not for muscular thighs,"Not that i don't recommend, only don't recommend if you have muscular thighs. so i tried on the small in plaid pattern (or checkered?) and not flattering on me at all. snug on the though and loose by the knee and below. also that pattern made my legs look weird, no kidding, kind of crooked... they are super comfortable and the small fit, so perhaps they run small?

19,31,Wanted to love,"This was my favorite item in the august catalog & i knew i had to have it. my store had not received it yet so i ordered online. after reading the other reviews, i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material. this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit. however, this top hangs like a tent. also, the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable. i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar",3,1,4
19,32,,"This is a great tunic for those of us who like to wear leggings as pants once in a while, it covers all the important parts without being too baggy. i found the fabric to be light and comfortable, but heavy enough that a light colored bra can't be seen underneath with it great if you don't feel like wearing multiple layers.",5,1,0
19,33,Love,"Just received this top in the mail & purchased at the sale price. beautiful classic piece that can easily be dressed up or down. excellent quality & fits tts. for reference, i'm 5'5, 120lbs & ordered the sp & xs, i kept the xs. the sp had an elastic waist, there was no drawstring. not sure if this applies to all petite sizes or just the one i received.",5,1,0
19,34,Not so flattering.,"I thought this was adorable on the model, but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan, but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs.",2,0,0
19,35,Flowy blouse with a little sparkle,"I ordered this blouse after it went on sale - i'm not typically the blouse-y type, but i thought i'd try it. for me, and i'm a pretty consistent small across brands, it was quite flowing and a little long, but that may be what someone wants. it was a little light in color to look good on me, but i think this would be really cute with dark skinny jeans - easy to dress up or down :)",4,1,0
19,35,Love this top,"This top is so much prettier on. you can dress it up or down. it does run a tad large. i'm 5'7"" and 145 lbs. i am usually in between a small and medium but usually a medium. i went for the small on this and i loved the fit of it. still pretty flowy and the medium would have been just too big. it is a tunic so it runs kind of long. a tiny bit too long for me but i will still wear it a lot.",4,1,0

19,39,Unique,"I am usually between a s/m.  bought it in the small and glad i did.  the blouse is billowy.  had some trouble at first getting the top to stay ""off the shoulder"" because it raises up when you raise your arms (obviously).  stretched out just enough and is now comfortable.  the black lace design at the bottom is different and pretty.",4,1,0
19,41,Gorgeous colors,"This is a really beautiful top. the colors are lovely a subtle. it is larger than i expected. i ordered a small which is my usual size and it is more of a baggy tunic. it still works because the material is so sheer, but does not fit me like the photo size down",4,1,0
19,41,Summer lovin,This is the perfect summer top. super lightweight but with a little swing in it so it is not tight across the hips. the bright colors go with almost anything and the detailing at the top makes this dressier than a regular shirt. great with skirts and jeans!,5,1,2
19,42,"Beautiful top, but a steep price tag","I really love the colors of this top, especially in the pinky pastels. it fits really well, can be tied or untied, and will pair with just about anything from skinny jeans to pilcro shorts. speaking of that, i do recommend pairing it with skinny pants or crops because it does have that classic retailer ""am i hiding a pregnancy"" feel to it.

19,43,Awesome!,"What a wonderful find! yes, it runs big. .. and beautiful! love the quality, and design. very light and airy. this is great for me because i'm not short & i am busty & i love tunics. this item can be dressed up or played down with class. the lining is a perfect complement to the tunic as well and fits nice with the garment. i am usually to busy to write a review, but i felt obligated on this item. five stars!",5,1,9
19,43,Best top ever,"I own quite a few pieces from retailerplogie but this one is my favorite by far! the color is a crispy white. the length is just right and has a beautiful flow to it. it is more fitted on top but flares out for a feminine appeal. i am 5' 1"", 115 lbs. i bought the regular xs and it fit like a nice tunic top. perfect for a curvy figure- i wore it with my tight jeans and boots. got compliments from everyone!",5,1,8

19,44,Even prettier in person,"I ordered this top in the pink in a medium (i usually wear a small or medium in retailer shirts). it fit tts with not being too short. the embrodiery is very pretty, better in person than online. my only complaint is it's a bit blousey, so you would need to either tuck it in or wear with skinny jeans/shorts. for reference, i am 5"" 4.5""' 135 lbs and a 32c.",4,1,5
19,44,Great colors,The larkspur tank is colorful and the embroidered bib is beautiful. the material is soft but not diaphanous. it can hide my little pouch without looking like maternity clothing. love it!,5,1,0

i would highly recommend!!!",5,1,0

19,47,Gorgeous top! love that it comes in petite,"I saw this on a girl at the winery where i work and i thought to myself - i have to have that top! it is perfect for the fall season. the pattern/print is very intricate and lovely. i think it fits true to size - the petite xxs is just right. the sleeves do not come to the wrist, but the photo here depicts that already. the elastic in the arms feel a little tight, but that would be my own negative comment. the fabric is beautiful and flows just right - it does not feel to big to me at all. i'm s",5,1,1
19,47,Petite frames will love this!,"The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction.",1,0,0
19,47,"Too boxy, pretty material","I really wanted to like this top. in person though, the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.",2,0,1
19,47,,Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.,2,0,11

19,51,,I normally don't care for rayon clothing but the fabric feels nice and it is flattering in the way it fits. i got my usual medium and it fits well. it has a nice drape and is not see through.,5,1,4
19,52,Sleeves not like those on the model,The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.,1,0,0
19,52,Top has great colors,Love this top! very flattering and fits true to size! top hits below mid thigh.,4,1,0
19,53,Better in person,"I am going to have to disagree with the first reviewer. this is not the most beautiful top i have ever purchased from retailer, but i like it. it is a nice change from the swing silhouette that tendd to look like maternity wear on me. the key to this is to tighten the drawstring a bit. it is a working drawstring all the way around, and i find that the top is much cuter with the drawstring cinched a bit. i actually like the flowing arms, too. the fabric is lightweight - nice for the very warm midwe",4,1,9
19,53,Not worth the price,"I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber, ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.",3,0,6
19,56,Cute classic with a modern twist,"I'm very surprised by the review given that said this was frumpy. it it absolutely adorable, and the classic plaid is timeless. as first reviewer said, the styling of this on the model does it no favors. it is in reality form fitting but in a very flattering, forgiving way. the waist nips in nicely underneath the top section, then flares out on the bottom section. that bottom flare can sometimes add inches/pounds but this top does it in a very modern, subtle and flattering fashion. and the mater",5,1,1
19,57,Beautiful tunic,"This is beautiful tunic for the spring and summer. great paired with jeans or white denim. runs large and is a true tunic length. very pretty fabric and built in camisole, too. only downside is that it probably needs to be hand washed/line dried to keep it looking like new.",4,1,2
19,57,Cute top,"I got this top in the pink. the colors and pattern are beautiful - i received so many compliments. it is very comfortable - it is ""swingy"" so i paired it with skinny jeans.

19,70,Party in the back,I saw this top on a store mannikin and was drawn to it by it's color and print. it looked great with blue jeans on display and a lariat necklace. then i noticed the different design on the back below the yoke. the surprise was its being pleated into very fine pleats. i liked the funky quality this added. the design is a good transitional piece to wear early fall or under a jacket. it is machine washable and that finalized the purchase of it. i bought the necklace too. i often wear a small but go,5,1,12

22,56,,I had to order on line -- so popular that my store had sold out! i ordered the cranberry colored jacket and love the color. fortunately the salesperson talked me into a small as it runs fairly big (i'm usually a true medium). i can't wait for the weather to cool off so i can wear it!,4,1,2
22,64,Beautiful,"I've wondered abt this swtr but hesitated to order being it has dolman sleeves. decided to wait for it to come in at the local store. yesterday i spotted it in the store & tried on the orange, labeled 'red' online. i was really looking for the 'cream' but the store did not have it. well, the orange is really much prettier in person. fit is perfect in my usual size s. overall body fit & length is generous, sleeves are wrist length & i'm only 5'3"". most likely the sleeves will be shorter on taller",5,0,23
22,64,Itchy!,"I love the idea of this coat and foolishly purchased other items in happy anticipation of its arrival.

the description does not say ""lined,"" and i hoped for soft wool that i recently got on the ""yellow with white piping"" sweater coat. this is hard, coarse, itchy wool - impossible for me to wear an unlined garment. i am consistently puzzled by the high prices for garments that are unlined when they really need to be. it went back, and i cannot really recommend this as i know i am not the only",3,0,22
22,65,"Perfect, flattering sparrow jacket!","I was in my local retailer to scope out a different piece, when i spotted this very attractive, well-designed jacket. sparrow's jacket looks dynamite on. the scale is perfect for me; the high level of detail is ideal. i chose this over getting an oversized sweater coat: it felt like these proportions were most flattering on my body. it will be appropriate for work or nice casual events. i bought the medium, true to size; i am an 8 top, 5'1""130#, 34f. although i largely buy online, sometimes you ju",5,1,9
22,66,Love this beautiful jacket!!!,"I don't care because i like be it so much; but, make no mistake, it is not black but rather a dark navy. however please don't let this fall negatively on your decision to buy it. it's fabulous!",5,1,1
22,67,Comfy jacket,"I love this jacket. something to get cozy in on cool california winter nights, and still light enough to wear open and walk around without getting too hot. i am 5'3' and have a medium frame but 34 dd on top. i bought a medium because i hate things to be tight around my chest, and this is perfect. my only disappointment is that i wish it had pockets. i got the wine color and it is very beautiful. wonderful, unique and comfortable jacket. i do recommend it.",5,1,0
22,68,My new favorite jacket,"I love this jacket and always get compliments when i wear it. i have the green version, and the color is lovely. the sleeves are the perfect length ( i got a petite size) and it is very flattering. the jacket is not warm enough for a really windy, snowy day, but is perfect for cool fall days.",5,1,0
22,73,,"This piece is gorgeous in person. it is more of a broen than taupe and goes with everything... it is more of a coat than a sweater. i bought one for my mom, and picked one up for myself when it went on sale. it is moms favorite piece among her extensive retailer collection.",5,1,2
23,26,Adorable print,"I knew i needed to have this shirt as soon as i saw it and luckily for me, it was already on sale. i read the other reviews and ordered a s (usually order xs or s, but went with s for this one because i was worried about the fit of the bust). overall the shirt is huge on me. i considered returning for an xs but suspect that would also be too big and maybe too short. i decided i could get it tailored instead for the cost of exchange shipping. so i will be doing that. otherwise i love everything a",4,1,1
23,32,"Beautiful top, just not perfect","I got my usual xs (i'm a 32b) and the top fit fine from the chest up. my head just fits through the hole on top without having to unbutton. but then from the chest down, the shirt billows out too far. it hits me at the hip like the model (i'm 5'6"" and wear 2/26) but because of the extra fabric it really needs to be longer to balance out the trapeze look. since the top portion fits nicely i almost want to keep it then have a seamstress take it in a little at the waist so it's more a-line than tra",3,1,1
23,32,Buy this if you want a crop top,"I absolutely loved the print on this shirt, and as soon as i saw in the catalog i knew i had to have it. the velvet is beautiful and the pattern is even more rich in person. unfortunately, the shirt is very thin ? much thinner than i'd expect with velvet ? and is so short that it is more like a crop top. even with the shoulders pulled down for the off the shoulder look, the front of the shirt hit me barely below my navel. for reference, i'm only 5'1. i would buy this over again if it were only l",4,1,0
23,33,Design flaw,"Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately, none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;)",1,0,0
23,33,"Small in bust, tts in torso","This top is a tough one. i ordered my usual medium. i'm 5'7"", 165 lbs, 34c, and wear a 10/m pretty much all the time (tops and bottoms). let's begin:

the bad:
when i tried it on, i found the bust to be too small, and the darting on the sides puckered in a very non-flattering way. the ruffle at the neck stood up more like a mock turtleneck (which is not my scene). also, the fabric seemed a little thin for chambray.

the good:
the pattern is adorable. the sleeveless design would be great under bl",3,1,23
23,43,Beautiful fabric,"Love the pleating on this top. looks great with my
white jeans. it's lightweight and has a slight sheerness.",5,1,3
23,43,Great print!,Love this crinkle cotton top for spring. the print is great and i can't wait to wear it!,5,1,4
23,54,Does not have a straight line fit,"The fabric of this top is lovely. the fit not so. it does not fit as shown on the model. the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a ""swing"" top. i am 5'9"" slim build. i ordered my usual size medium. shoulders and back fit perfectly. too much material around the middle. had it had a straight cut to it, as shown, i'd keep it. because it doesn't it's going back.",2,0,2
24,19,"I liked this sweater, with reservations","I liked this sweater's design, i like tunics. the sweater is a light weight knit.the sleeves are long. i got the green, which is lighter than the picture. the slit on sides go up about 18 inches from the bottom. the sweater is comfy, but a shirt is needed under or your ""love handles ""will be showing, if you have them. i also ordered the cream color, but it was more brownish than white, so i returned it.",4,1,0
24,21,Have to have it,I absolutley love this sweater. is is very cozy and warm and can be paired with many different outfits. i am upset i didn't get one in every color!,5,1,0
24,21,Warm and cozy,"This coat is a perfect fall to winter transition coat. it is surprisingly warm in 50 degree weather, so i'm sure it will be warm enough in 30-40 degree weather with some added layers. the only thing to note is that it is unlined and the material is soft so it may be prone to pilling. can be worn casually, to work, and dressed up.",4,1,3
24,22,Good sweater!,,4,1,0
24,22,Loved it!,"I got the small even though i usually order a medium for sweaters because i prefer them bigger and i'm glad i got the small. the sleeves are very long (which i love) and the sweater is also loose fitting (also, love). the color is gorgeous and it is thick but super soft. i wouldn't wear anything underneath it unless tucked in because the front just comes to the top of my pants. overall, it's gorgeous and i would definitely recommend this!!",5,1,0
24,24,Best sweater jacket!,"Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 5'2 and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. it's easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that it's not super bulky, which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far.",5,1,2
24,24,Love this,"I bought this in the store and it is beautiful, the red is more of a faded red/burnt orange, not as bright as pictured, which is great. i am usually an xs or s and was a s in this item.",5,1,3
24,25,Thick and cozy,Great sweater. cozy and thick. the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place. the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater. i got a small and it fit perfectly.,5,1,0
24,25,,"I bought this mostly to wear around the house, so i'll keep it because i got it on a pretty good sale.

that said, this runs really large. the sleeves are really loose, and it doesn't really hang well over my hips, which is a shame. it's very soft and cozy, which is nice, but i don't think i'll leave the house in it often. it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel. i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling, bu",3,0,0
24,26,Classic with a twist,"I wish i hadn't waited so long to buy this! the smalls were sold out in grey by the time i finially did, but the medium ended up being totally fine. perfect for a warmer winter, it is pretty thin so i wouldn't trust it on it's own to keep you warm in cold weather, but easily could be layered! i love the fun aspect of the tie front for this sweater as the front tuck is becoming a little tired in my eyes. i love that you can make it shorter or longer or even tuck it in because the ties aren't sewn",5,1,1
24,26,Comfy!,"I love this sweater! it's extremely cozy and great for wearing with leggings due to the length. i ordered the red color in a s and it fits great and it is long, like i had hoped. the red is really more of a burnt orange than the red in the photo, but i actually like that even better.",5,1,0
24,26,Pretty but not what i was looking for.,Disappointed with the fit and color of this sweater. more of a rusty red then bright cherry red. i ordered a small and found the sweater had no shape and just hung lumpy on me. i am 5'5 120 and usually a small in retailer sweaters.,3,0,1
24,26,The best.,"I can't say enough good things about this sweater. i bought it when it was full-price and it was totally worth it. it is incredibly soft and looks very sophisticated. i wish i could live in this sweater--given the color and my propensity to make a mess, i want to buy two more just in case!",5,1,1
24,27,Comfy but no good,"The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on, however the material is thin and slightly see through.
also, after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it, i discovered a large hole in the armpit, most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater.",2,0,1

24,29,Must have,"My favorite of the season. i purchased the grey sweater while shopping with girlfriends. i love it so much i'll be purchasing the brown as well. i would normally wear a m/l but tried it on and purchased a s. i don't like very fitted items. however, a small fit perfectly on me. this item runs big.",5,1,0
24,29,Terrific sweater with great detail; runs large,I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large - so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly. love the length- it hits mid hip. it is more of an a-line than straight as show in the picture. the detail is fun and the sweater is well made. highly recommend it- i have received lots of compliments on this sweater.,5,1,0
24,30,Love this coat,Lightweight warm in cold nice as a day jacket. works well as a casual coat. very soft but a little wooly. it's really nice color. thinking about buying another. i got the dark one.,5,1,15
24,30,Very vintage!,"This sweater caught my eye months ago, and i recently picked it up on sale at a great price. it reminds me of something betty draper would wear on mad men; it has a fabulous 1960s feel to it. and, everyone loves pockets! i love the combination of peachy pink and cream, and the sweater it quite warm. the fit is good, although on me, the buttons gap slightly (this is easily remedied by wearing a shirt underneath, as shown on the model). i'm already dreaming up lots of fun outfit combinations!",5,1,0
24,30,,"The sweater looks cute if you get the right size. it meant to look a little oversized, i think. the color is pretty in person, however it looks different online and in person so keep that in mind. the material is very warm and a little itchy you will need to wear it over a long sleeve undershirt. the look is nice but it is for a cold day.",4,1,4
24,30,,"This sweater is absolutely gorgeous. the design and structure might make your shoulders look a little bigger, but i absolutely love it. it has a little boxy shape but i feel like it goes with te style. love it! get tons of compliments every time i wear it.",5,1,0
24,31,Big bold and beautiful but not for me,"Lovely print and colors. interior lining was so super soft, but it did lay right on me, felt very big and bulkly and i wasn't a fan of the single snap closure, esp being so low, so i decided it was not for me at that price and returned. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c and the s was too big. it is beautiful and i will consider the xs if the price is cut further.",4,1,7
24,31,Shapeless,,3,0,1
24,31,So pretty but...,"I love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite, but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso. when i raised my arms up, it bunched up all wrong because it's a very thick sweater.",3,0,5
24,31,Surprisingly cute!,"This is a surprisingly cute faux-fur coverup! it's much cuter in person than on the model. i will be wearing mine over a little black dress, for the holiday parties. it's very glam! perfect for going out. it's also very soft, snuggly, and comfy. most faux fur makes me look gigantic and wide, but this one looks a bit like a little capelet or shrug, and very flattering. it flares out nicely in the back too, and it has a pretty lace-knit stripe pattern on the back. it does shed a bit though. also,",5,1,10
24,32,Great fall/winter piece!,"I purchased this piece in store in a size small, ivory. i am usually a size medium but the small fit perfect! material is soft, lightweight, and very comfortable. collar can be buttoned to create more of a turtleneck look or unbuttoned to create less of the same look. i'm so glad i grabbed this because it is a great cold weather staple and i doubt they will last long!!",5,1,1
24,32,Perfect stable,I am so pleased with this product. it is a great staple for every woman. my one complaint is that it easily pulls.. something to be mindful of when handling the garment.,4,1,2
24,32,,"It pills a little under the arms and picks up lint, but it's totally worth it. this is a fabulous sweater coat. i receive compliments on it wherever i go. so cozy, warm & delicious. not too hot to wear indoors either. it's breathable. love it. bought in green during black friday sale. highly recommend.",5,1,0

24,33,Love love love!,"I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however, after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing, so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person, and very soft and warm. it's a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5'-7"", 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly, though it's a little shorter on me than shown in the photos.",5,1,1
24,33,Nice sweater :),Got so many complements! really comfy but runs big! i'm usually a large and i wish i had gotten the small.,5,1,0
24,33,Not sure about this one,"I'm surprised other reviewers loved this one so much. it's completely different then how it looks on the model. it's much shorter, which others do mention, but it flares a lot. enough to feel maternity-ish on me. it looks fitted on the model. maybe it's my shape, i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips. i ordered an xs too. i will say the material
is very nice and it's well made, but it's going back.",3,0,1
24,34,An elegant design but...,"I agree with the other reviewer, this is a nice piece. i felt so-so about it when i tried it on though. see below.

___________
pros:
- not too heavy or warm due to being part linen/cotton blend, making it breathable and great for more milder temperatures.
- soft floral arrangements with lovely pattern throughout the sweater.
- lovely collar giving it a sophisticated feel.
- ran tts. i'm 5'9, hourglass with some meat on my bones and found the medium to be an ideal fit.

cons:",3,1,14
24,34,Chic sweater,,5,1,11
24,34,Cute layering option for fall,Color and style was pretty but the sleeves were so long i had to return it. cuffing the sleeves wasn't an option because you would lose the cute piping detail and see the inside seam.,4,1,3
24,34,Great fall/winter sweater,"This sweater is a great, comfy fall or winter sweater. in several of the pictures the neck is folded down, so beware that the neck has a bit of a turtleneck/mock neck look to it. it can be folded down if that's not the look you're going for. cute sweater!",5,1,1
24,34,Perfect for cooler weather,Completely versatile and absolutely perfect for days when my pea coat is too heavy. looks amazing with jeans or with slacks for work. i highly recommend this jacket!,5,1,0
24,34,Super cropped sweater,,1,0,1
24,35,Absolutely perfect,"If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest, this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition, but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone, and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy.",2,0,9
24,35,Cozy chunky sweater,"The color and weave of this sweater is really beautiful and it looks very expensive. it is heavy- this is not a lightweight cardigan so save it for the coldest of days! i wore with a white tee like in the picture and jeans, and i did have to roll the sleeves up like the model. i'm not sure that i have a jacket that would fit over this sweater because it is somewhat bulky, but i am still very happy with the purchase. you could wear this at home to lounge in, or out and about for casual outings.",4,1,4
24,35,Just what i was looking for,"On the real...i needed a sweater they gave my tummy some room! what yes i'd love some more pumpkin pie. know what im saying?! what appeared to be lack of constriction in the belly region of a tiny model, made me hope with fingers crossed it would look like that on me. please please just swing and not cling. mmmmm...k. the majority (70%) of the fabric content is natural and a sale was going on so i went for it and purchased this sweater online. so glad i did!",5,1,2
24,35,Not retailer's best,"This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and, without a chunky statement necklace, it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn't any style to it - has to go back.",2,0,9
24,35,Perfect for any season,This is more beautiful in person. i love the detail and color. i usually don't like ponchos but this one's shape with the square front definitely sets this apart.,5,1,9
24,35,Pretty but unsure,"I love how unique this vest is. i'm still figuring out how to wear it in a feminine way, as it lacks shape at the waist and the collar sometimes doesn't behave. i think the sweater texture makes it more casual, but i could belt it and wear with fancier shoes to glam it up. it is a nice third piece to keep warm for fall or winter--hopefully i""ll wear it more once i figure it out!",4,1,0
24,35,Super comfortable but big,"I am 5'8 154 pounds and ordered a medium. the coat is a bit bigger than expected and should have gone down a size. i'm keeping this size however because it is incredibly comfortable, roomy and perfect for mild winters. the wool does keep you warm in 50 degree weather.",4,1,0

24,35,,I just received this and had ordered it in my normal size small and it is way too big! sadly xs is sold out so i will just have to return mine. the style is like a swing coat and zips up the front. the material is thinner but nice and can be worn over sweaters or bulkier items! the color is more beige in real life.,4,1,0
24,36,Gorgeous,"I tried on this sweater in the store and immediately ordered my size. i got the petite small in natural delivered to my door several days later and am extremely pleased. the fit is roomy enough to layer, but not too large or boxy. the wool is fluffy and luxurious and has terrific appeal. i get compliments every time i wear it...""classic,"" ""fancy,"" ""jackie o."" are all terms i heard used to describe my favorite new sweater. the coat is made from a medium weight wool and is probably not meant for e",5,1,1

24,37,Gorgeous!!!,"Every year around this time, our beloved retailer comes out with a wool sweater coat. i've seen every style over the last five years and this year they have outdone themselves!!! this coat is a dream. not too thin and not too thick...it's the perfect layering piece. the fabric has perfect stretch in it. the colors are lovely (i ended up with the cream color, but i loved the green too!!) in many sweater coats i prefer an xl, but because of the stretch the l was just perfect. i'm 5'8 and it hits wel",5,1,8
24,37,Knock out!,"I'll admit, i had a lot of sticker shock when i saw this was a moth sweater coat at this price point. but i was immediately drawn to it. this is a one of a kind piece for sure. the colors are vibrant, the design is stylish and it is beautifully unstructured. it has a cocoon shape, wool on the outside and a soft knit on the inside. its a bit heavier (as you would expect a wool coat to be.) my absolute favorite part is the print. very classic on top, and very boho on bottom. it is gorgeous. i woul",5,1,45

24,38,Beautiful sweater,"I really love the look of this sweater and it seems to be of great quality. i will say the fit is a bit odd. the sweater is on the short side but is very roomy through the neck and shoulders. i ordered a small (5'6""; 120lbs) and would change for an xs but i'm afraid it would be cropped. i'm keeping it but wish it had a more uniform fit.
really beautify workmanship though.",4,1,12
24,38,Beautiful sweater,"This sweater looks alot better in person. the picture online doesn't do it justice. this can be used both as a sweater or even like a lightweight jacket. a very versatile piece added to the wardrobe. definitely worth the markdown price!
only con, is that it has some fluffy pieces in the yarn that comes loose on wearing and sticks to other fabric. so wearing it with black pants might cause a problem.",4,1,1
24,38,Beautifully knit sweater,"The ivory color needs a little camisole or tank underneath. the sweater is beautifully knit and has a soft and nubby texture. hope it washes well. maybe size up if you want a looser, relaxed feel. hits me right around the hip bone and i am 5' 8"". can easily be dressed up or down with accessories.",5,1,12
24,38,Didn't work for my curvy hips,This jacket is really pretty and unique. unfortunately the material around the waist area does not lay flat like it does in the picture. i'm 5 ft 6 in and a size 6. i ordered the medium. it fit well but the material around the waist area jutted out making me look really wide. disappointed to have to return this.,4,1,9

28,59,One of my most favorite purchases ever,"This is one of the best purchases i've ever made... i have had the black for over a year, and every time i wear it, i receive so many complements. i've dressed it up with a striped scooped back shirt, or a fitted sweater, and paired it with flannel with a belt... i love it. i'm 6' ft and slender, and the xs it hits me at the perfect length just below the knee. i recently ordered the silver in a small (it's a little big in the waist- but nothing a corset belt can't help) for nye. love this dress!",5,1,1

29,66,Nice but longer than i hoped,These are really cute and done in a substantial knit type fabric that drapes well and doesn't cling. i ordered my normal size large. so i'd say they're true to size. the leg isn't too wide and bells out nicely toward the bottom. the color variations are striking but on me they made me look wider than i am. i'm short and the hem hit at the top of my ankle instead of the cropped look shown. think they'd look best with shorter tops. i decided to return but still highly recommend.,4,1,2

these pants, in general, are my go-to pants--so i had high expectations when i bought them.

31,56,Really cute spin on indispensable ankle jeans,"I have to disagree with some previous reviews -- i think the buttons on these ankle jeans really set them apart. they look absolutely adorable with booties, flats, wedges, heels, anything! and they're extremely comfortable and flattering, as most pilcros tend to be. i got my usual size 26 and the rise and fit is great. i think maybe they stretch out a bit; i've only worn them a couple times and by the end of the day the waist seems a little loose. but overall, great and a good price (at least co",5,1,12

34,25,Not worth it.,"While i love the fabric and the pattern, this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.
there is no mention online that there is no built in slip, and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through.

34,30,Disappointing,"This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting. the material is stiff and rough. the skirt is also loud. you can hear it swishing when you move, and not in a classy way. it feels like you're wearing a very long tutu. also, the pattern isn't quite as pretty in person. they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow.",1,0,18

37,42,Big and boxy,"As previously mentioned, this dress runs very large. i ordered accordingly, and the small was the right size for my frame, but it was just not flattering. i'm pear shaped, and i found the shoulders to be large, the neck a bit too high, and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way. i'm 5'4"", 140-ish, and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller, it could've worked. i so wanted to love this, because it's soft and comfortable and cute, but back it goes.",3,0,2
37,46,Love it!,"I bought this dress at my local retailer store on friday and love it! the dress is well made, with some heft to the yarn. the colors of the yarn, blue, white and grey, seem to shimmer a bit due to their weave, but there is no metallic thread in the dress that i can tell. i know some have written that the dress is a sack, but not on me. i toyed with buying this online and then didn't due to the negative comments about the dress; i bought an extra small and it fits well (i usually where an x small,",5,1,5
37,47,Cute but not for me,"It's a nice drop-waist, embroidered, lightweight dress for summer. my problem was that the armholes were too large for me and i found that to be unflattering. it's a swing style so it's forgiving in the hips and belly.",4,1,2

37,58,Great dress!,I wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it.  i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger.  it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness (such as myself).  i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting (for me).,5,1,0

38,24,A very blouse-like dress - very cute,"This dress is very cute on. very flouncy. i know it looks like a gingham dress, but it's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern. the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size (bug or small), and i am larger on top, so i don't know what would happen with someone with a small chest. i wouldn't have minded if it did the same thing on the front, but it was just the back.",3,1,0
38,24,Careful curvy girls!!!!,So after ordering this dress and trying it on myself i was able to make sense of the previous reviews. this dress is constructed very oddly. the top seems to have no room for any hips. it is a straight construct so if you are like me that has an hourglass shape but has a pair of hips i would size up. i bought this in a 6p and in all colors. first off the colors/ patterns are amazing in person very adorable. this fit my 34ddd bust without any problems and no problems in torso either. it was reall,4,1,2
38,24,Comfortable and classy,"Hack: wrap the sash around waist twice and tie in back!! agreed with other reviewers it is a bit sack like when the sash tied in front as seen on model. but wrap twice, and it makes the silhouette pop. fabric is rediculously lush, and pattern is very sophisticated. stunning dress, will be wearing all summer -- with flats for work, with heels for evening. oop, my usual size, fits perfectly (5'4, 110 lbs).",4,1,4
38,25,Cute and comfortable!,"I really liked the style of this dress. the top was nice and stretchy and the bottom is so soft and silky. i love lace and thought that was a nice detail for the top. the colors are a little brighter in person, the red in the pictures here is more of a hot pink in person. i'm planning on buying some hot pink flats to wear with it at a wedding this summer!

38,26,So much better in person,"The pictures of this dress are terrible compared to seeing it in person, and i instantly fell in love with this dress when i put it on.  the fit is very flattering with a touch of 1920s flare. the colors are better in person too, with the lightest color being pink, not white as pictured.",5,1,5

38,28,Muted colors but comfortable and slip-on,"This dress came with two pieces, a black sheath slip and a sheer pattern top-piece (pictured). it's pull-on and comfortable and flows well. i ordered online but wish i could have selected the pattern, as the fabric differs a little from front to back both in the pattern and intensity of color. overall though, a comfortable, light summer dress.",4,1,1
38,28,Pretty but didn't fit me well,"Disappointed this didn't fit better. the pockets stuck out on the sides, and it was baggy through the middle. you could also see the pockets through the outer layer of the dress. the color is more like a chartreuse than the picture. it's really pretty!",3,1,0
38,28,,It's a bit baggy (i'm normally a 6/8 medium but went with the small here). i debated for a while but finally went for it on sale and i'm so glad. the colors are just gorgeous in person. delicate stitching on the shoulders adds a feminine touch. great with my jean jacket which gathers up the extra material just right. looks great with summer sandals and booties for fall. i love love love this dress!,5,1,0

38,29,Dress up or down,"I don't usually write reviews, but i loved this dress in the store and would have passed it right over online. the skirt is a charcoal color and the top is an antique white. it gives the appearance of a separate crop top. i would usually wear a small (5'2"" and 125 lbs.). i'm wearing a small in the photo, but ended up going back for an xs. the dress could go more casual with flats or boots and a scarf, or dressier with heels and jewelry. i think i'll get a lot of use out of it.",5,1,1

38,31,Oddly short-waisted,"I found this dress to be very short waisted, much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture. it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i've gotten from retailer. it really could have used those inches above the waist. just a strange fit overall.",2,0,4

38,32,Mango is mine!!!,I love the cut of this dress! i have to be honest and say that i initially bought the blue color at the store and after falling in love i decided that i deserved to have the mango colored one as well after seeing my sister in it! the sizing is just a tab big but it works for the design. so i would say stick with your usual size. amazing pop of color especially for summer. the back design is gorgeous and the gold streaks running through it  are wonderful. do yourselves a favor and just try it on!,5,1,2

38,42,An easy and polished dress!,"This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished! it is not a ""cheap polyester"" fabric as one reviewer wrote. it is a rayon and nylon blend. it does wrinkle easily. i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back. i don't typically gravitate toward warm color palette, but the burnt orange color is really lovely. it can be dressed up or down very easily. and it has pockets! i typically wear xs in retailer brands, and the size 0 fit me well.",5,1,0

i read all the reviews and very few were favorable and still took my chances. fabric color and textures is great but the design is really off.

39,57,Cute top!,"Purchased the gray patterned top. seemed to fit tts, but it didn't fit me. i'm an athletic build with a 34d bust and it just wouldn't fit right around the shoulder/neck area. i'm pretty confident it would fit someone who is less busty than i. the double-sided fabric was soft and felt like it would wash/wear very well. nice length all around...top and sleeves.",3,0,0

fit: i am normally a 29/30 depending on the jean. i took these in the 30 - i usually have a difficult time finding skinny jeans that fit my legs and don't fall off my waist. these have enough give to accommodate my larger legs, but the material holds well, so i don't need a belt to keep them up",5,1,0

44,39,Love it!,"I wanted to wait until i could give this dress a thorough wearing before i reviewed it.  it exceeded my expectations!  i wore it at an outdoor wedding (the red) and received so many compliments on it.  it is well-constructed and the cutouts are gorgeous.  no danger so far of them ripping or tearing.  the zipper in the back is a little bulky for the dress, but not a major deterrent.

44,42,Great dress,"I initially bought this dress to wear to an interview that required something casual, yet could be dressed up with interesting jewelry. although i ended up wearing another black dress, i kept this.  paired with interesting black booties and a great necklace, this dress is easy to wear  - and stylish. most importantly, comfortable. i could see myself wearing this on days that i feel inspired to dress up, but want to wear something that is not fussy. and, the pockets!",5,1,0
44,42,New favorite dress,"This is my new favorite dress. while elegant it isn't too fancy for a nice office environment. very comfortable and a perfect size fit. i would like it if it was in petite only to make it hit above my knee, not below since i am 5' 3"" but not a big deal. everyone has complimented this dress!",5,1,0
44,43,Expect it to be the same length as on model,"It was a little shorter than i expected i am 5'8 and 125 pounds. i ordered the extra small and it was a perfect fit aside from length. at 42 yrs old, i can't wear mid thigh dresses to work. hit hit me at the same length it hit the model in the picture.... even though she is 5'10. if you are 5'6 and below this is a beautiful dress",4,1,2
44,44,Needs a zipper,So i ordered a 0 and p0. when i received them i could tell right away that i'd prefer the 0 and it looked to be the perfect size. then i tried to slip it on over my shoulders...it was tight. it was the right size but it was so hard to get on over my shoulders and then to take it off i needed my husband's help. it fit great otherwise. i loved the feel of the fabric...the design of the bodice. going up a size would not help me as then it would be too large in the bust area...i'm a 32b but i do hav,3,1,5
44,44,Nope,"I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7"") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also, i like to have the first button open, but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding",2,0,3

44,50,Curious juxtaposition,"I loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives. the grey color is drab, yet leaves room for creativity. it's stylish yet wrinkles horribly. i am 5' 2"" so it hangs too low in the front and armpits. another reviewer mentioned the buttons, yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest. the pockets are a great space for hands, yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits, so will not hold much. i typically wear a 4 petite and the small fits",3,1,5

what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that, although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin",3,0,31
49,59,Love,"This top is so cute. i don't usually like crochet tops, but when i saw this i just had to order it, so glad i did! my only complaint is that one of the button hooks broke, but that can be fixed.",5,1,3
49,59,Snag this before it's gone!,"Great news if you missed out on this tank last year! this s the exact style and cut as last season's buttondown tank released by c&s. 

super flattering fit, not too poofy. it *is* semi-open in the back and the slit goes as high as the last button. super sweet for summer and goes with virtually everything. i reeeeally wish they had this one in more colorways. it's grrrrr8!

49,60,Nice staple with a twist,"This is a really nice white button-up top. per usual, the cloth ant stone material is awesome! ... and a machine washable blouse! the side buttons are a really cute feature as well. i found this top fit true to size, and i took my usual xs.",5,1,3
49,60,Summer time blues,Nice rendition of a summer halter that resembles denim. i bought my normal small but could have downsized to an xs. if your busty stay with your normal size as it is more tts. i like the blue plaid colors and the soft cotton material it's made of. it has a very nice flow with the cute peek a boo back neckline. the interior fabric lining is also a quite lovely chambray blue that nicely offsets the blue plaid.,5,1,4
49,61,Great purchase,"I adore this top! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that's been worn for years. it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round.  even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders,  it still works and looks just fine. i'm broad in the shoulders, and we'll endowed,  but the large was perfect.",5,1,3
49,61,,I couldn't resist this basic white button down with the cute side buttons that added some interest. i bought my usual size large and it fit perfectly. the soft substantial fabric from cloth and stone never disappoints. i love the longer cut since i'm 5-10 and love a long shirt to hide the belly pudge. the blue is darker than the online picture shows and i'll probably be going back for that but at almost $100 i'm hoping it'll go on sale.,5,1,3
49,62,Great for summer blouse,"Yes it is thin but a great summer blouse. the body runs true to size, but the sleeves are tight..i may try to size up so the sleeves can be more comfortable.",4,1,1

49,69,"Nice drape, lovely navy","I've been looking for a navy shirt for some time and this is it. it's soft, drapes nicely but it's not as dressy as silk shirt would be. the navy is really blue, not a black-navy like so many. i've washed and dried it in the machines and it came out well. shrank just a little, but that made it perfect. for me it was true to size because i liked the slightly over-sized boyfriend fit, yet it still has shape. if you want a fitted shirt, go down a size or look for something else.",5,1,7
49,70,"Cozy, soft shirt","I love this shirt for its subdued colors and casual style. it is lighter in weight than a flannel shirt but retains a feeling of softness. it is from cloth and stone, a brand i like. usually i buy that brand in a small because their shirts run large for me. i liked this shirt so much i ordered it twice and waited for a backorder. i sent the small size back and was lucky enough to get a medium before the next out of stock situation.",5,1,2
49,70,Perfect white blouse,I love white blouses in the summer. this one is perfect. bought one size down and it is perfect. the lovely tailored neck is very flattering and hard to find. i do send it to the cleaners just to make sure it keeps that crisp cool look for hot summer days.,5,1,1
49,72,Beautiful!,"This shirt is more beautiful in person. it has a lovely hand feel (soft) and the blue is as shown but a bit more vibrant. i bought it for my 13 year old niece. she loved it! she may have to return for a small, but i do feel the size ran true to size. it depends on how you want to wear it.",5,1,4

( i am a 38b, 5'9"", and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts.) the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest. when directly compared to the medium, it seems the major difference is the length-- the large was > 1"" longer than the medium. i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok.",4,1,0

61,53,Very nice,"These embroidered jeans are very nice. they also exist in a lighter wash which i prefer because it shows off the embroidery better. the embroidery is dark navy which is almost not visible in these darker jeans. i guess if you like something very subtle these jeans are for you. i personally would have like a more contrasting color either white or red for the embroidery. these jeans are loose and expand with wear, it is perfectly ok to size down.",5,1,0
61,53,Very unique jeans,"These jeans are very unique thanks to the embroiding. would have perferred colorful embroiding though. they are boyfriend cut, but not slouchy. just a bit loose even around athletic legs. they run true to size, but have a lot of give. after wearing them for a a little bit i catch myself pulling them up a bit. if you want a snug fit and are between sized i would go down a size.",4,1,10

the sizing of this really depends on the desired fit. i elected to go with a size small because i felt that it fit a little bit closer to my figure and the length seemed to go better with skirts. but honestly, i tried the medium as well, and it was much different... just a bit more slouchy and looser in the arms if layering is desired. for reference,",5,1,4

65,26,"Great color, not so great tailoring","I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said, i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length, down for arm length ...",2,0,9
65,26,Nice top but strange fit,"This top is very nice. good quality, good design. it just doesn't fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top, especially around my shoulders, while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured, perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.",3,0,15

65,27,Strange,"I was struggling with the options above-- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large? it is both too small and too large, which is really strange. the model makes this shirt look stunning, but the product is actually very boxy. i am 5' 3"", weigh 112 lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs. i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy. quite frankly, it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money",2,0,1

65,30,Lovely idea that does not work,"I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps, which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps, so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h",2,0,18

65,33,Baggy,I read the other reviews that said the shirt ran small but i found that it fit fine and i chose my regular size in maeve. the only issue is that it's baggy around the middle which is a little off and i found that it was a little too short. i gave it four stars because of the print. i chose the cat print and it's just so adorable. i might try to have the shirt taken in at the waist and then it would be perfect.,4,1,1

65,34,Flirty and fun,"I am 5'5"", 145 lbs, a cup. depending on the style of the shirt i am between a medium and a small at retailer, in this case i purchased a small. even in the small the body has ample space which adds to the relax look without appearing sloppy. and because the shirt is wider i would say you can easily size down. the shirt is definitely flirty and fun with a great print, and easy to wear off of the shoulders. i invested in another retailer top that is also an ""off of the shoulder"" design but it does not",4,1,6
65,34,"Fun, colorful top","Top was featured in an email ad. i love the colors in both tops and bought both plaids. i'm 5'4"", about 130 lbs, and the medium fits well. it is long in the back, but i like that. if the front were a little longer, i'd prefer that, but the length is ok. the colors are definitely cheery and mood-enhancing, very appropriate for this holiday season.",4,1,1

65,36,Gorgeous but tight on muscular arms.,"I bought this in both the navy (a more saturated blue in person - gorgeous!) and green, but both are going back. it fit everywhere but in the upper arms, even across my chest, and i usually encounter the opposite. i think it might just be the way it's cut across the shoulders that don't allow for much movement. so, while beautiful and so incredibly soft, it has to go back.

65,48,Runs very small,"First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small, which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close, on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru, but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.",3,1,1

this top is a cropped, even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement), but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full, so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up, too. the quality is an issue, with exposed threads and irregular seams.",3,1,0
65,52,The fit is the thing for this top!,"I normally avoid white tops because they usually don't have that pop,but when i saw the 50's styling on it i just had to try it. i came in to buy another top from their catalog but it was such a wow i walked out with it instead.",5,1,5

65,53,"Again, my bad for not looking at description...","I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh.

65,60,Lace chambray top,"This is every bit as lovely as shown! the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks, lace embellishment's and covered buttons. for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) my normal size. i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area. going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts. i think it's a wonderful rendition of a denim top. this would work in any season of the year.",5,1,8

65,60,Perfect top for work,"I got this top in navy and i love it. it's loose and flowy and comfortable, yet dressy enough to wear for work (or dress down with jeans). i'm 5'4"", 125lbs and the 6 was a bit large on me. i could've sized down a little but i actually liked the loose fit, and the length was long enough to tuck in if i wanted to. definitely recommend.",4,1,0
65,60,Thumbs up for the downhill skier blouse,"I had my eye on the skier blouse for awhile before i gave in to the purchase. love it for fit and graphics - those happy little skiers! i think many reviewers here don't realize this blouse has the cut of a swing style. it's not meant to be tailored for tucking in. if you want to tuck it you'll be wearing a high-waisted skirt or pant, cute also ;-)

65,62,Beautiful!,Absolutely love this in blue. the cut and fit are flowy while still having a flattering shape. the colors and pattern are accurate on screen - vibrant and rich. the tie front is a pretty detail allowing the top to feel a little dressy. very happy with this purchase!,5,1,1
65,62,Cute!,"I had a hunch that this would run big based on the style and brand, so ordered an xs instead of my normal s and it was perfect! the fit on me is exactly like the model shot - swingy but still cute and falls nicely. i am 5'7"", 128#, 34a for reference. i got the orange color and would say it is a little more on the reddish/burnt orange side than what is pictured. it's very cute - i'm happy to keep it at the promo price.",4,1,28
65,62,Pretty in blue,"I ordered this top in xs and blue, its subtle but pretty on, as the style gives it a boost. it is a bit snug in the shoulders (cut a little snug in armpit?) but i would not want it larger. it does not affect the appearance, is not uncomfortable, just noticeable when moving arms around. nice fall top, want to try with blue or white jeans and boots.",4,1,3
65,62,Weird maeve sizing/fit,"As another reviewer mentioned, maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent. i ordered a 4, and while it fits, i think a 6 would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders (and i'm a thin build). the length on this was also a little weird to me...a little swingy/flared, but also short, making me feel like i'd always be playing with it while wearing. the orange print is absolutely adorable, i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don",3,1,2
65,62,Why we love maeve,"Another great whimsical print by maeve! as of late, this brand has really fallen all over the board for me, but this top had the right fabric, fit, and pattern to hold onto the parrot print. it looks great loose or tucked in. the parrot print has plenty of accent colors to make this match with many things. cute!",4,1,1

75,45,Attractive,"I was not impressed upon first taking it out of the package, it was a wrinkled mess,lighter weight than i imagined and i felt like it hung like a potato sack. however after i gave it a good ironing and used the inside back tie to sinch in the waist i was in love. it draped beautiful, the blue has beautiful embroidered detail and i love the full length sleeves that can be rolled. i feel iike i will use for many seasons.",4,1,2
75,45,Perfect jean jacket,"Per other reviewers, i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers. it is short (cropped), but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses.",5,1,1
75,46,Cropped,"How can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size, yet others say it runs small? i think it's because this jacket is cropped. by the time i took advantage of the fall perks 20 percent discount, the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s. i also got the xs gray to compare. sure enough, the xs looks better but is cropped on me. for ref, i'm 5' 5"", 32a, 115 lbs. i don't really need another almost black jacket so i'm either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr",3,1,2
75,46,Pilcro faux fur denim jacket,"Denim, faux fur, flannel... hooray! i absolutely love this jacket and i'll wear it all winter (even under my warmer winter coat). i'm 5'6""/130 and usually a 2-4 in retailer and the small in this coat was plenty big in the waist/chest and even had room underneath to add a second shirt or light sweater. it seems a little shorter on me than in the photo... maybe that's the only drawback.",5,1,1
75,46,The best!!,"I tried this on (in the store) on a whim....then had to have it!! i'm normally a small but really loved the way the medium fit. good thing because it was the last jacket like it in the store!! super soft, comfy...a great purchase!! fur is removable for easy washing or a different look!!!",5,1,0
75,47,Basic with a twist,"Wasn't too sure about this jacket when i got it in the mail - seemed a little boxy on - maybe a smaller size would've worked better but i want to be able to layer. however, i'm keeping it because it's versatile, i love the contrast of the front/back and the buttons on the sleeve (which actually button and un-button, meaning they aren't just for show and the sleeves can be easily rolled up). a great basic jacket with some neat details.",4,1,1
75,47,My new favorite denim jacket,I'm glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. it's roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! it's very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim.,5,1,0
75,47,Runs small especially the arms,I love this jacket. it's the prettiest and most stylish jean jacket i've ever owned. the sleeves run small. i'm an xs but chose a small so i can button it and wear thin sweaters underneath.,5,1,0
75,48,Really cute!,"I saw this a few months back and wanted it then and now i bought it. i missed a few promos but i ended up getting it at full price in a large, my usual size i like in the pilcro denim jacket line. i love pilcro and have several of this brands denim jackets and each one is very special. i love the use of the plaid details. it has a weathered appearance - the denim and my distressed treatments are not too severe, as some reviewers have commented on the ""holes"" . i will say this jacket runs small.",5,1,2
75,48,Very impressed,What a great jacket. love the subtle windowpane design and the color blue is a nice denim hue. i chose my standard size i wear in retailer jackets on this in house brand. i wish though it was made in the usa as i have several other jackets by cartonnier that are made in the usa. thus jacket looks so polished with jeans to a denim skirt to a bottom that is similar in fabric and texture. very happy with my purchase.,5,1,0
75,49,Lovely jacket,"I really like this denim jacket with the plaid underneath. i also like the removable fur lining being that i live in florida i really don't need that. i ordered a size small which is my normal size and a medium. the small was tight in the arms so, i decided to keep the medium. i am really glad that i followed the others review in regards to sizing.",5,1,0

75,55,Almost perfect denim jacket,"Love this denim jacket (also have it in white) the reason i didn't give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much (none on the back which is kind of strange). i'd love it even more if it wasn't distressed at all, then it could be dressed up much more for work. but overall it's my favorite, great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy. please make this in some other denim colors!",5,1,0
75,56,Beautiful,I really love this brand and i love the fit of this blazer. my bottons were loose on this jacket and i got the rose color too and i do agree with the other reviewer that the color is more terra-cotta. great for spring and cool summer night. it runs tts im a 36dd and the medium fit nice.,4,1,8

75,61,Great versatile jacket,"I saw this jacket in a store and wanted it right then and there. i bought a shirt and scarf instead but it was on my mind. when i saw it on sale i grabbed it. the fit is a little boxy but the length was perfect! not too short. the small amount of spandex is so comfortable. it is versatile because the green arms can go with colored jeans well. i am 5'4"". i can wear a med or large. i bought the large. it fits perfectly to layer short or long sleeves. not a typical denim jacket. looks great over a",5,1,2

75,67,Built in saddlebags,"Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the ""captain kangaroo"" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.",1,0,2
75,67,Uniquely cute,"First of all i love retailer, i am 67 yrs old and my whole closet comes from the store. this jacket is way cute. the color is very nice and the fabric is nice. only complaint is i wish the cuffs were just a bit tighter/smaller.",4,1,1
75,68,,"Love this vest. fits very similar to the pilcro denim jacket. the fabric is softer, and not too heavy. the wash on mine is pretty close to the one in the picture, maybe half a shade darker. can see myself wearing this with summer maxi dresses, skirts, and pants, a very versatile piece that will go into fall. i usually take a 0/2 and the xs fit perfectly.",5,1,1

78,34,Simple and classic,"As you can see from all the reviews, this dress is such a classic piece. my two cents below:
____________
pros:
- fits tts. i'm either a 10 or 12 in most clothes and bought the l and it fit really well on my 5'9. 36c bust and hourglass frame. it wasn't boxy at all and still left enough for movement and still held a nice shape to my frame without being clingy.
- fabric is soft. it does seem a tad fuzzy, so just be careful what you wear. but the material overall is nice. i'm not sure how thick",4,1,1
78,36,Nice dress but could be better,"I purchased this dress in the red color. overall quality is excellent. the zipper was a little hard to work because the lace kept getting caught in it. the neckline was also too high.  i'm 5'1"" and 107lbs. the dress fit perfectly.  there is was too much nude fabric showing through the dress. i feel that this dress isn't versatile. to me this is somethings that would be great for weddings or bridal/baby showers. due to the lack of versatility and the fact that i wasn't in love with it, i returned",4,1,0
78,36,Only for no chested women,This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.,2,0,3
78,38,Hmmmm - disappointed,"I wanted to love this dress - everything about it was so beautiful - except the fit , the length, the neckline ... i tried on a 4, 6 and petite 4. i'm 5'5"" 130 32dd - the top of the dress runs small/tight - so i needed to try it on without a bra.
the length on the regular is to the floor/with the petite to my ankles. the print was beautiful and like in the photo, it flowed nicely but there was just too much fabric - maybe it was just the design for me - it did nothing for my figure at all",4,0,1
78,39,"Beautiful green, great fit, scratchy","I love this dress (from the moment i saw it online), and now that it is on sale, i ordered it (green). i do wish the flesh color was a little more pink, love the color in person, but not as flattering on my pale skin (i ordered a different similar dress in teal and purple, that oclor was better).

78,39,Trusted my instincts,"My wardrobe craves lush detail-rich dresses like this beautiful maxi.  knowing that the dress is expensive and made of all synthetic fabric, i took the plunge and purchased the largest of my size range.  i've noticed that most indian labels commissioned by retailer fit tighter in my chest/shoulders, so i'm glad i trusted my instincts and bought the 12p as it fits perfectly on my 36dd chest and wide shoulders.  this is not a casual dress--there are sequins, beads and rosettes decorating the bodice.",4,1,31

78,63,Size way down,"I'm 5'8"" usually a size 2/xs and i bought this in a petite xs. never would i have imagined i'd want a petite size but i accidentally took it into the fitting room. the shorter length and less billowy effect is much more flattering. that said it still hit just below the knee and is very loose and flowing, but in a good way. :)",4,1,0
79,27,"Nice, but weird fabric","Nice practical tank, that i can wear with everything. but, the fabric is kind of weird - overly warm and pulls up around the bottom when i wear it sometimes. i would still recommend it, but just know it's not just a cotton tank.",4,1,0
79,29,"Love the look, but hem rolls up","Great material, and i like the idea of a scoop / v neck combination. but the hem rolls up, making it impossible to wear not tucked in to pants or a skirt (and even there it's a little bulky). it's possible that ordering a size up would fix the problem.",4,0,0

79,53,Should have looked more closely at description...,"This spandex top, in my opinion, is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive, but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is, it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but, as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",3,0,1
79,54,Versatile,"I have these in many different colors, some with stripes. very versatile and i wear them all year around.holds well through the washing. love these tank top.",5,1,1
80,19,Great shirt,"I saw this shirt online, loved it, but unfortunately it was sold out in the regular size small. however, retailer shirts tend to be long on me, so i ordered a petite small. it fits great! i am actually happy i got a petite because i feel a regular would have been too long. the shirt comes to my hips. for reference i'm 5'8"" 145 lbs. and my measurements are 34-27-38.",5,1,9
80,20,Casual or dressy,"This is a really great top. it is really soft and made very well. it could be a casual top with jeans, or, dress up with some chunky jewelry and cute heels. i wasn't sure which size to get because i mostly get mediums amd i sometimes get a large. i ended up going with a large and it seemed to be just a little too big, but it doesn't have that look at all. it looks so much better in person than on the computer. overall a very cute top!",5,1,0
80,20,Cute but too large,"I love this top and the beading is beautiful, but just like everyone else, it was way too large. i normally wear a lg, but the large looks and feels like a 3xl. beautiful but large",3,0,0
80,20,Not my favorite purchase,"I love the design of this top, however, it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer, so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!",2,0,5
80,22,Love the lace up design!,"I love the lace up design and bought the red xsp, fabric is a bit thin and mediocre quality, but over all happy with purchase. wish this top came in navy and white as well. even a navy/white stripe would be a fun option too. thanks you for offering this top in a petite size. :)",4,1,1
80,23,Lovely top,"This top can be dressed up or down. i got it in the blue motif. it is so cute and that wearable, washable fabric. i am a medical student so it is important for me to be able to wash my clothing and not wear things too low-cut (i.e. professionalism). this top fits the bill while still being fabulous. of course it is loose-fitting on the bottom, as the image indicates. it is a swing top. i recommend with skinny pants.",5,1,0

80,26,Awesome top,"I love love this top and bought it in both colors. it runs a tad big but fits me well. both l and xl fit me well, but the xl was longer so i have one in each size. i really like this top. it looks good, goes well with most pants especially blue, and is very comfortable. i am very happy with my purchase.",4,1,0
80,26,Nice top,,4,1,0
80,26,Ultimately unimpressed,"I really like how this looks on the model, but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work, but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it, a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so, best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.",3,0,3

80,30,Lovely tank,"This was a bit of an impulse purchase but i'm glad i added it! it's a pretty standard tank, but is thoughtfully and well made. for example, the arm holes are not enormous like they are on some tops. i wish everything fit like this. the cut at the neckline isn't too modest or too low and the fold over of the drawstrings are structured enough that they don't flop over.",5,1,0

80,31,Great but need something under it,"Love the shape of this top. i bought in white and a friend bought in the neutral pink. we both required a tank/cami to layer under it. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small.",4,1,8
80,31,Nice top,"I would give this top a 4.5. it is a very pretty top, i love the embroidery, but runs a little short for my taste. it still meets past the top of my pants, but barely. this is why i didn't give this top a 5. i am 5'9"" so i think for a petite person the length would be perfect.",4,1,7
80,31,Runs large,"Love the print and comfort of this tank, however, it does run about 2 sizes larger than normal. it is also not a fitted tank, it has some flow which is not exactly what i was looking for.",3,1,6
80,32,Adorable must have,"I just received this and wore it immediately - it is cute even under a cardigan because the pattern 'peeks' out, giving some depth to an otherwise plain white shirt. the material is soft and sort of on the thin side but not see-through. it is a fine knit, and has a satin-like thread to it which makes it soft and cool - perfect for a summer day! it is not as slim on me as the model but i am very petite (51 100 lb) and i think this would run closer to tts.",5,1,27
80,32,Cute and comfy,The tank top fits well. i usually boarded between a large and an xl and i got a large in this shirt which was perfect. it is kind of thin material so i wear a white tank under it. it's not too big in the armpits which is nice so my bra doesn't show. material is really soft and comfortable. it fits loose but not baggy.,4,1,0

80,32,Love this,"I am 5'4"", 170lbs, 34dd and a medium fits beautifully in this top. the mint green is very pretty, and a nude bra under it works without showing and without it being see-thru. it is super soft and pretty, and doesn't cling. i love it!",5,1,1

80,33,"Easy to wear, casual-elegant","I ordered this in xs and it fits loosely (i am 5'3"" and about 120 lbs). this looks great with skinny jeans or leggings and shows off the long necklaces that are in style right now. the chiffon doesn't lie perfectly along the side seam, but i'm sure only i notice.",4,1,0
80,33,Great top!,"I love this shirt, i had my eye on it for awhile but wasn't sure what size i'd be, so i went to the store to try. they only had a small which i figured i would be but it was a little large and not as fitted as i would like it across the chest. i got an xs and it was perfect; i am 5'1 about 120 lbs and a small c cup and it fits great. i love it!!",5,1,0
80,33,High hopes that were dashed...,"I was so excited about this top, as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately, this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit, the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way, due to the layered fabric. 

sadly, going back.",2,0,26
80,33,Nice casual tank,I bought this in two colors : the green which i love and the washed out look adds some interest to make this other than a plain tank. i also bought this in white and it is completely see through. i will never understand why designers don't pay attention to how fabric would look as soon as you put a bra on. if you want to wear a tank under your tank then get the lighter colors otherwise i would stick with the green.. honestly debating on whether to buy the bright blue color but i fear it's just n,4,1,12

80,33,Pretty,"I don't usually spend this much on a top but despite the high price, i really love the style. i like that it's made out of cotton and it can be worn down on the shoulders or left up. looks cute both ways. i ordered the xs which is usually my size. it fits perfectly. i imagine the s would have fit also. it hits just at the hips. i have a long torso so i would have liked it a bit longer, but it's not a deal breaker. my one splurge this summer.for reference 123 lbs, 5'5', 32 d.",5,1,2
80,34,Adorable,"I'm very glad i snatched this up when i did. it is super soft and the perfect length. i love the slight peplum as it makes for a very flattering fit. i can tell this shirt will be a staple year round as it works great with shorts or jeans. for me, i think the large was a tiny bit big in the waist, but it might shrink in the wash. the armholes were nice too, and didn't gap.",4,1,0

80,35,Cute but ...,"I thought this top looked adorable. and the material was soft. tops like these don't usually look great on someone who is a little bit busty, it can make you look fat or like you're wearing maternity. but the real issue was the arm holes were large and seemed to gape a bit. it just didn't look flattering. even if you wore a cute, lacy bandeau bra, the way the material sticks out around the arm holes would still look awkward. too bad, since it is a cute top, and well made.",3,0,8
80,35,Cute top,This top is really pretty & i think i will be happy when i pull it out in the spring to wear it. the only complaint is that the front is very sheer. you have to wear an under shirt of some kind.,4,1,0
80,35,Everyday staple,"This shirt is amazingly soft and has such a great cut, especially for me being curvy. i love to pair this with cute leggings or tight ankle jeans with my boots. recently wore on a casual date with the hubby and he loved it paired with my dark brown leather jacket and dark jeans. 

only reason i gave it 4 stars was that the shirt tends to stretch out a little at the bottom is seems as you wear it throughout the day - it is still a great shirt and if possible i would buy more.

80,35,Love this top,"I desperately needed some new work clothes, so i ordered this and a few other shirts online. this was the only one that fit me really well and that i really liked! it's a bit pricey for a tanktop, but it feels really well made. the material is soft and comfortable and the ruffle details and the print are beautiful. the small fits me perfectly (5'7"", 150 lbs, 36a) and it's not short like a lot of other shirts i try on, (which my coworkers probably appreciate since no one wants to see me flashing",5,1,0
80,35,Perfect until washed,"Loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors. love the luxurious feel of the silky, flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways. however, after washing per instructions, the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah, pilled mess that gathers at the seams (especially the bottom seam). tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing. looks like a cheap, lackluster layering top now and definitely won't last another season. so disappointed - if you ca",3,0,0

80,35,The circus is in town,"At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette. the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because, in person, the shirt fits like a circus tent. without exaggeration, there is a surplus of about 16 inches.

the material is still beautiful. and because of that, i haven't decided whether i'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner, more fitted shape.",2,0,0

80,36,Classic,"This top caught my eye in store because of the fabric texture and light gray color. i wasn't too sure i'd like the cut on the bottom, but the neckline was so lovely i thought i'd try it out. i went with a small which is my usual (if not extra small) and loved it as soon as i put it on. the shape is very flattering, even with my post baby figure. i definitely think that it's better in person than in the photos online. and the price seems very good for a lovely sweater that's both classic and mode",5,1,6
80,36,Cute style but a little large,I ordered the red/navy and i love that its a true red and navy. the subtle ribbing adds the right amount of texture. i normally order size small but i felt the top was a little big and has a very long hem line. i'm hoping it shrinks in the wash and i might alter the hem if its still too long after washing.,4,1,4
80,36,Great basic with some flair,"Great causal tank! the back is a bitter longer than the front - i'm 5'6"" and the back-model shot was right on for where it his me at the hip/butt. the material is a poly/spandex/rayon mix that feels predominately like polyester and rayon and has a little bit of give.

80,53,Poorly made,"I wanted to love this. it is so cute and the xxsp, my usual size, fit perfectly. however there was a fatal flaw in the construction. the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided. instead of a scoop like shown on the model, it was much longer on one side than the other. i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me, but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong. this is going back. i ordered another one (now it's on backorder), hopefully",3,0,5
80,53,"Runs large, esp. in black!","Just received two, the red and the black. the black is a great print, very versatile. both run large, but the black most significantly so. the red is close enough to fitting to keep. the black shows my bra b/c it is so large and the armholes cut far too deeply. (the red also shows a fair amount of the armpit area, but (barely) covers my bra.

the material is somewhat thinner than expected, but not so sheer that a skin-toned bra wouldn't be sufficient.",3,1,2

80,54,Wrong for me,"This is really a cute top, nice fabric, the print (the version i bought) is lovely though the colors are different than pictured. the problem for me is that i am 5'8"", 36b with a longer torso and the proportions were just wrong on my body. the blouse does not have much shape at all and fell a bit too short for my liking, especially in the front. it hit at hip level, as in photo, but would look so much better if it had been a couple inches longer. looking at the other reviews i see that most of t",3,0,2

80,55,Great fall top,"Originally ordered a large but it was huge. the medium fit perfectly. i'm 165lbs, 5'7"". lovely material and interesting side details. the sides do come up quite high but a camo or tank underneath does the trick. lots of compliments!!",5,1,0
80,55,"Pretty, colorful top",Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.,5,1,0
80,55,Well made,"I wanted to love this top. unfortunately, the color & fit didn't work for me. i'm a 36ddd. the fit was ok, it even flattered my bust, i just felt the stripes didn't flatter my waist. this would be perfect for an athletic frame.",4,1,0

80,56,Cute & unique tank,"I love the bright floral print flanking the solid white middle in this top. with its swing style and large arm holes i think i could have sized down and been ok, but i usually wear a cami with my tanks so the arm holes are not an issue. also, it has a touch of spandex in it which make it extra comfy. overall, a darling top!",5,1,2
80,56,Flattering fit and comfortable fabric,"Happy to have tried this one on in store. unlike other peplum, the bottom portion does not pop out. looks good under a cadi as well. find this top very versatile. i got both colors since they are both flattering.",5,1,1

80,57,Lovely color; beautiful detailing,"I am usually a size small and had to size down to an xsmall. as mentioned in another review, it runs large in the armholes and across the bust, which is why i'm counting off one star. the armholes are also cut in quite a bit, so i will wear either a strapless or racerback bra. i am fairly small busted and the gathers falling from the yoke lay nicely; however, i can see that it might not work for someone who is more amply endowed and that it might have a maternity look. that said, the detailing i",4,1,2

80,58,Really nice tee,I got this tee for a great price online and i did like it a lot. i got it in medium and i might have liked it better if it was just a bit bigger or if the material wasn't quite so clingy. i decided it had to go back.,4,1,2

80,61,Summery,"This top makes you feel like you should be in the tropics sipping a frosty cocktail. fabric is soft, not too sheer. i'm usually an xs and that's what i kept in this top. armholes not too low as in some. for reference, 5'4"", 123 lbs",5,1,2

80,62,Need them all!,"Ordered this on a whim while taking advantage of a promotion, and now need one in every color! the weight and cut is perfect for fall/winter/summer - not too heavy, but not sheer/tissue thin; fitted enough to look super cute with leggings or skinny jeans. fabric has a nice quality feel to it - i have similar shirts from the past that have held up well in the wash. i'm anticipating the same with this.",5,1,1
80,62,"Unique, casual top","I was drawn to this top due to its unique detailing and soft, casual cotton feel. i wear a nude bra underneath with no problem. i'm 5'5"" 120 (34c) and the small hits right at my hips, so it's not to short or too long. i often wear an xs in tops and i didn't even try on the xs in this one because i felt the small fit just right. with the cutout detailing, i'll hand wash this. i hope it holds up.",4,1,0
80,63,Fun change from the norm,"Fun detail with the beading and lace! arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected, but that's the style of the piece. the fit was tts with those proportions mind.  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up, it might be a little longer in the body, but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change. the material isn't too thick, so it's a nice lighter layer for fall/spring. really love it!",5,1,0

80,63,What happened?,"I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin, and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material, but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric, with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex",1,0,0

80,64,Cute styling,"This shirt is semi-fitted. i like it because it is not boxy but not overly tight. it is not heavy even though it is a sweatshirt material. i wish the neck was a bit higher but i will wear a tee under it. the back is really cute. 
it is different and i like that.",4,1,0
80,64,Excellent if you do not have a chest,"I received this today and will have to send it back. it is super cute and the quality is great. however, you need to wear a bra or a halter bra due to the style which is not a proble, but my 32d chest looked huge in this top so it is going back.",4,0,2
80,64,Love the look- couldn't resist,The uniqueness of this top caught my eye online. i normally wld not want a long sleeve top in the summer. a bit warm to wear outside now but i like the casual but unique style of it. it's a top i can wear now but only indoors with a/c. the regular small fits fine. a little oversized & sleeves a little long - as in the pic. the color/style/detaling is exactly as in the pic - no surprises. soft & comfy. a little opaque but a nude bra will work fine. i don't see the need for a tank/cami under it. i,5,1,3
80,64,This top is versatile.,"It's really a casual tee, but with the cute pattern that gives a pop of color, it can have a little more dressed to go out look. i thought it might be a bit wide by the picture, but has a nice flattering flow. a bit expensive at full price but an amazing score on sale.",5,1,1

80,65,Soft as silk,"Really, this top feels like a wonderfully expensive soft silk knit. it is just so very soft. the drape is really nice and there is stretch to it, making it very comfortable. it does have a tendency to fall towards the body, even though it's loose. so, i'd buy your regular size.

it's a thin material, but i don't think it's sheer at all. i bought the dark red/wine color and it's so classy! i love it. this will fit taller women easily because the arms and total length are on the long side (i sup",5,1,0
80,65,This is a wonderful top!,"After reading the reviews, i decided to order this top. i was so pleased, and when i wore it for the first time, i had someone ask me where i got it. it is perfect with leggings because it is long enough to cover my leggings in the front as well as in the back. i want to order it again in different colors.",5,1,0

80,66,Not so much,"I carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles. the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice. the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra. the colors are deeper than shown. but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top. i liked that the sides are shorter but overall it's just not my style. better suited i think for taller, slimmer bod",3,1,2
80,67,Great for summer,"I just got this top and can't wait to wear it for spring/summer! it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably. it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely. this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side, so trust me on this! overall, i highly recommend this top if you're looking for a muted but unique, comfy top for the warmer months ahe",4,1,2

83,45,Lovely,"I wasn't sure how the knotted front would look on me, but it lays perfectly. very comfortable, well-designed, flattering top in lovely rich colors. i'm normally a small-medium in retailer tops, but i got the large as it does run small and i don't like things too clingy. so best to try on in store rather than buy online. nice simple statement piece!",5,1,14
83,45,Oops forgot to dry clean,"So i love this top. i got it in black and red. both are amazing and go with about anything. they run a bit large. i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck. i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry. i would say it shrunk 10% at most. beyond that, no difference. in fact, it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big. obviously, if you do not dry clean this, you are going against manufacturer recommendations, but i",5,1,0

83,46,"A good idea, but...","I really love the idea behind this. however, the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops, and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.",2,0,2
83,46,Gorgeous tunic--interesting mix of colors,I ordered this tunic in xl and it fits me true to size. it's such a fun piece to wear. i like all of the embroidery which was done in beautiful colors and stitched well. the different fabric and the cut make this a very flattering top. i tie in the green and pink in my jewelry and sweaters when i wear this. it's so comfortable too. i'll get good use out of this top for winter. i like the uniqueness of it.,5,1,1

94,38,Cute top with some caveats,"I purchased the green online, in my usual medium. i do like it but i will be returning it for a few reasons. first, i couldn't justify the price as it's really not unique enough. it kind of reminds me of a pajama top. also, i thought it was 3/4 sleeve, which it is not, it's long sleeve. and lastly, it appears to be regular length on the model. i'm maybe 5'4 at best and it's shorter and boxy. i gave it 4 stars because i really like it for what it is, but just not what i expected. it is cute, spor",4,1,21
94,38,Disappointing,Purchased this in two colors online. purchased in an xs - i am usually a s or xs. the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering. returning both.,2,0,1

94,38,Great top!,I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons!,5,1,0

96,42,Fun multi season pant,"Purchased the navy/green and the red/brown. ultimately exchanged the red for the black/gold. the charlies tend to run small, so size up one. i normally wear a 26/2, but needed a 4 in these. the side zip makes for a slimming fit. i'm 5'3 and it is an ankle fit. i've paired a sleeveless silk navy blouse with the blue pant when the weather was warm and now i pair with a white oxford and navy cable knit sweater. i see many more possibilities for both pairs. fun print and fabric that can work through",4,1,0
96,42,Unfortunately unflattering,"I wanted to love these great spring/summer pants, but sadly, they are just too unflattering for ladies with hips. if you have a ruler build, these pants will be fantastic, but these pants are not forgiving in the hip and thigh area for those of you blessed with a curvier build. i was really hoping for pants that had this clean, vintage inspired, audrey hepburn look re-imagined for the every-girl, because nothing is more flattering to an hourglass body than clean, non-bulky lines (something like",3,0,3
96,42,Wanted to love these...but...meh...,"Uncertain about sizing i got both the 4 & the 6...both made me look like a no-asser :( neither fit quite right in the leg. both hit at a weird point in my calf, not cute-short, just off.

96,43,I love these pants!,"I have a few pair of charlie's and one thing i really like about them is their consistent fit. i own this pair in both the orange and gray, bought both in my normal 4. they will stretch so if they are a little snug at try on don't size up. definitely recommend these pants.",5,1,1

96,44,Great pants but seam issues,"These are really great fitting pants. they are perfect for work. i noticed a little stretch throughout the day but just the perfect amount. the only draw back is that after wearing them once, i noticed a 6 inch opening at the seam of the back leg. i had to get the tailor to fix them. they need to work on the seams in the future.",4,1,0
96,44,Love it!,"I bought this in-store after seeing it online, and am in love with the shape! the cropped legs give it a style advantage in my opinion.  for reference i'm 5'6"" 120lbs and a bcup. i got the xs. 
the torso was too baggy and lost it's shape with a small.  
as one reviewer mentioned it seems to be meant to be worn with a shirt underneath. i've tried with longer sleeved tops and with tank tops and they both look great - especially white. 

it has a modern cut and is very versatile. i plan to wear",5,1,2

96,44,So stylish....if only by butt were flatter,"Probably should have noticed the material this jumpsuit is made of before buying. tencel, thus little to no give,kind of like linen and silk. beautiful material, soft with a slight sheen. the top portion fits well and the triangles cover the girls well (36dd). unfortunately there is no give on the back end for my bottom which is quite round and its tight around my thighs which aren't small either. (l/xl and 14). and sadly an xl would be too big upstairs and baggy around the middle. sigh, oh well",4,1,0
96,44,Very stylish and fitting,"You have to try it on to see, it fits really well and looks stylish. i love it.
my only concern is the fabric is rather stretchy, not sure if it will hold up well in the long run.",4,1,1
96,45,Great pants!,"I love charlie pants. i've bought a few in the past, and i've never been disappointed with quality, style, or fit. i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result. i wish more pants were side zip- so much more flattering than having that part stick out under fitted shirts. i got these in a 4, my usual size, and while they fit a little more snugly than my other size 4 charlie pants, there is enough stretch that they don't look or feel too tight. i also got these in the regular, r",5,1,0

96,46,Funky but not over the top,"I generally like this style of pants- and these are particularly interesting, flattering and perfect for the season. love them.

the style can be bohemian and chic or more conservative. the color is also a dark navy, and there is black leather piping on the 'pockets' making them a neutral- navy or black. i've worn with a long sleeveless hi-low hemmed button down top and neutral (saddle) heels for work with a cream jacket- and with a t'shirt and flats for the weekend.

96,51,Lightweight classy work trouser,"These trousers are not lined. there is a wide elastic band that runs along the inside of these slacks that is not tacked down, which is a little cheap and probably to keep the price down but doesn't affect the overall fit. and they do fit nice. when your putting them on the fabric bunches at the crotch but then slims out after you zip them (zips up the back.) the fabric has some spandex in it but the lyocell makes them a great choice for work. they hit my ankle a bit lower than on the model. i'm",4,1,11

105,58,Re: love this jumpsuit!,"Purchased it in raspberry. first time it came in the mail, it was stained and the hem looked like it had been dragged through the mud! come on customer service, you need to be more diligent about checking out items before you ship them! i ordered it again, and this time it was a new jumpsuit in plastic, so pristine. 
i am a size 8-10, and the small fit me fine. the lining is a little tight in the crotch area, but i can put up with it for the style of this jumpsuit!!",4,1,0
105,59,Hard to top,"Great summer pants.....nice material, easy to take care of. i'm 5'6"" and usually wear a size 29, which i purchased the neutral. they might be a little bit loose, but they fit great, and best of all, they truly are slimming. i love them so much that i just ordered the green.......hard to top the sale price",4,1,4

106,35,Perfect !,"These jeans are my new favorites! very flattering cut and color, and very high quality. i've worn them a ton since i got them, and they haven't stretched out or lost their shape at all. only thing i would caution is that they run small... for reference, i wear a 26 in paige denim, a 27 in citizens, and 28 was perfect in these.",5,1,0

106,41,Wow!,"Bought these jeans after reading others reviews and was not disapointed. these are the most flatering jeans! they give you legs for days, while providing amazing shape. oh and did i mention their soft as butter. huge win for me as jeans are one of the most difficult items for me to my as my waist is 1-2 sized smaller than my hips and thes stretch marvilously to fit your body. they are on the pricier side and well worth it.",5,1,0
106,50,My new favorite jean!!!,"I have been a paige/pilcro lover for years! these mcguire jeans went on sale and i loved the neutral color so i ordered my usual size 28. they fit perfectly!! as a previous reviewer started, they are tight . . .they are skinny jeans and are meant to be tight. they hug in the right place, are not too high waisted and are a sturdy denim. for reference i am 5'2"", 120 # , short waisted and usually wear a 28 in paige/pilcro. these mcguire's, sized 28 were a great fit, good length, no hemming required",5,1,1

107,24,Nice but get loose real quick,These are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough. i would go down a size for sure. the cons aren't unsolvable so try them out!,3,1,0
107,29,Love these (vegan)leathers!,I bought these pants to wear while riding on the back of my husbands motorcycle. i wanted something that was more chic than typical motorcycle women's clothing and these were perfect. they block the wind but are stretchy on the back side so they are super comfortable to wear all day. i also wear these to work on fridays! i bought a size 28 and they fit great. i usually wear a 6 in us sizing.,5,1,0

107,32,Comfy and unique with some minor design flaws,"This is my 4th pair of these printed cords and they are beautiful- the color says navy but these are definitely black with a grayish print. very stretchy all over except for the waist band which is a little uncomfortable but it might loosen up some. i wish the rise on these was a little higher. also worth noting is that the design on larger sizes won't look exactly like the picture- my size 33's have the floral scroll print up the front and the back, but also the cut has the scroll print running",4,1,0
107,32,Quality cords,"I ordered two pairs of the red cords, one my typical size, one a size smaller in case i found that the pants stretched out. they run true to size and have a nice fit with a high(er) rise waist. the color is beautiful. i did not find that the pants stretched out but they do seem to bunch somewhat which may come from the thickness of the material.",4,1,2

107,38,"Cool design, extremely tight fit","The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however, the fabric, despite 2% spandex, has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4'), i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear, i think they would cut off the circulation.

107,38,Vegan pilcro,I initially walked right by these pants when i saw them on the rack. then i saw them on the fitting room attendant. they looked amazing . i ended up purchasing them and i love them . the great thing about them is the the leather is only in the front which makes it great for moving around and sitting down (the back is kinda legging like). i had to size down in these.,5,1,0

107,44,Short but adorable!,"I ordered these without reading the previous reviews and i would have to agree with everything everyone has already said. these are the cutest cords i've seen in a long time! they're definitely skinny, bridging on way too skinny through the calves but i'm willing to stick it out. the thing that bugs me about them is how stinking short they are?? the description doesn't really mention that they're crops but at this length any ankle bootie is going to be too short. also, they aren't navy. they're",4,1,1

111,55,Very flattering,"Love, love, love. i have both colors and wear with leggings. it's not a heavy sweater and has a great drape, super flattering. i'm usually a medium and it runs true to size - not supposed to be tight. i find it a little low in the front,but a tank underneath takes of it. washes well.",5,1,1
111,56,Comfy & casual,"This sweater is super cute. it has nice weight to it and is just a nice casual but attractive piece to wear with jeans or white pants. love that it zips and just a really cute pattern of marigold, mint/teal and grey/dark gray.",5,1,8

111,67,Not to fancy,"I was happy to receive this sweater in no time at all. when i opened the package it seemed too thin, however, after trying it on, it's the perfect fit and style. can be worn with jeans or skirts and even dress slacks. great buy.",4,1,0

111,70,Versatile vest,I love the black and grey version of the vest but decided too try it in plum. the plum color is used only on the lapels and inside of the garment. it has no finished seams but it is like a soft boiled wool so it wouldn't ravel. the seam in the waistline area breaks up the design and adds more interest.,4,1,4

112,52,"Comfy, long jersey tunic","I love most pure and good clothing pieces, mostly because the fit and fabric are comfy and made of good quality materials. this tunic does deliver on both counts, but i is very, very long and straight up and down.
fyi: i have a boyish figure, having no waist/hips. i have a broad shoulder/back, so the cowl neckline coupled with the very long and straight tunic doesn't really flatter my body. it would be okay for just haging around the house, but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this tunic out",4,1,18

113,23,Gorgeous tunic,This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really doesn't do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it's a stunner!,5,1,0
113,23,Perfect,"I wanted a turtleneck for layering with cardigans and vests. i ordered the burgundy color in an xs (my usual, 2) and the color is lovely and deep. i absolutely love it. the ribbed design is comfortable. the neck drapes as shown, so it is not constricting at all.",5,1,1

usually don't leave reviews here, but this top (material, beading, style) is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didn't. i have a short torso, so the peplum hit me above the belly-button. it's very voluminous, but with the right pants and heels, it is a perfect outfit. as a full-time student, i'm apt to find retailer expensive - but this purchase was so very much worth it. in terms of sizing- i initially got the s to accommodate my bust (30f) but preferred the xs.",5,1,0

113,60,Not a keeper,"I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body, however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve",3,0,1

113,69,Goes with anything,This shirt is a simple but versatile top. it goes anywhere with anything so it's a great travel piece. i'm curvy on top but short waisted and this shirt does a good job of disguising that figure flaw. i got loads of compliments from men who liked the femininity that stops short of 'sugary' as one guy put it. it's quite comfortable and doesn't bunch up when one sits down. i wore it with copper jewelry and that really made it 'pop.' a great piece for one's wardrobe.,5,1,0

115,28,Cute buttondown; runs large,Looks great with skinny jeans or even white pants. i have wider hips (usually an 8 or 10 on bottom) and narrower shoulders (small or medium on top). i bought the medium and probably should have sized down to the small as this was a little large on me but the top still looked good being oversized. i am a 34b and did not have any issues with button gap. my only negative is that the material wrinkles easily. the floral detail on both the pocket and the sleeves is a nice touch.,4,1,0

the fabric has a quality of freshly starched. pleasant surprise. it lacks softness of leisure",4,1,9
115,34,Strange armhole construction,"This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all, the armhole is way too low! second, there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper, it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.",2,0,0

118,33,Loved this dress... watch the side slits,Loved this dress! material is soft... the overall fit is great! the challenge with this dress is the side slits... they do go pretty high... too high for church but may wear them with leggings as it gets cooler... super cute with or without belt 5'9 135 lbs and i ordered a small.,4,1,0
118,33,So soft and comfortable!,This dress is really really soft and comfortable. it's loose but still flattering. i would definitely recommend it.,4,1,0
118,33,,"Man do i love this dress! love the fit and the quality of the fabric, lays really nicely. i gave it only four stars because it is super short. true i am 5'11"" but there is no way i could wear this without pants or leggings. i am super bummed because i really love it but must send it back.",4,1,1
118,33,,"This dress looked amazing in the picture. i am 5'10 and since the model was 5'9 with the dress dragging on the ground, i assumed it would be long on me as well. even with flats, this dress is an awkward length. the description says it is 62 in length but i measured it and the dress i got was 52. i will say that it's a beautiful fabric and the quality of the dress is great. it just doesn't look like the dress in the picture at all in terms of the way it hangs and the length.",3,1,6

118,34,"Great quality, unique piece","I am 5'3"", 130b, small waist, wide hips. dress fits perfectly, a little longer than i had expected (hits about mid-calf on me). great quality corduroy, nice medium green color. very unique, sort of vintage feel piece.",5,1,0
118,34,Great top for taller gals,"Tried this one because the ruffled detailing at the collar and sleeves appealed to me, as well at the cute button details along the back and the overall color and look of it.

pros:
- love the ruffle trim along the collar, bottom, and wrists. it gives it a really romantic feel to it.
- a definite winter piece. it's extremely warm and very thick and heavy, which i found covered any lumps and bumps nicely.

118,34,So cute,"This dress looks way better than pictured online. it is lyocel i think so it has a little bit of weight (not heavy and bulky like denim but not as thin as some chambray items i've purchased before) and lays great! i purchased a size small, i am 5'8'' 128lbs and thought it was true to size, i can't wait to wear this! warm weather, sandals and a tote for running errands!",5,1,17
118,34,Too short,"The dress is not like pictured. it is above the knee and sleeves are neither 3/4 nor full length-somewhere in between. i am 5'4, 112 lbs, bought xs regular. had higher expectations for the price. going back to the store.",3,0,2

118,35,Disappointed,"Ordered this dress and still haven't recieved it, but went to my local store today and tried it on in the size i ordered. it was too big. and now i can't get it in my size. so that stinks! quality was good and the dress was comfortable with stretch. i know in going to have to return it once it comes!",5,1,0
118,35,So soft,I really liked this dress. i agree with the others that say the side seam comes up pretty high. i think i'd wear as a tunic or open like the model. i can't justify full price though. tts. my normal med fit.,5,1,3
118,36,Clings to the body,"I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model, but on me it looked tacky.  i'm 5'6 and 130 lbs, and this dress hit me in all the wrong places.  i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress (and the arm holes are already dangerously large).  i wish this were just a little bit a-line.  instead, it's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt.",2,0,8
118,36,Flattering classic with a bit of flair,,4,1,2

118,37,Perfect dress for the fall!,"I am in love with this dress. not too dressy, not too casual and hugs the body in all the right spots. i am 5'7 with curves and this flatters well. i also bought (and adore) the velvet taupe ankle strap shoes they show with them, super in-love with the whole look. dress will look great with booties too. just hope i don't snag the sweater dress, which looks easy to do, because i want to wear this all fall and winter long.",5,1,2

118,39,Cute spring versatile dress,"Saw this in the store and had to have it. i got the green because its different. i am typically a 4 or xs in most dresses, sometimes a small. i bought the small in this dress until i realized it was a little too loose. if you like that look, the small could have worked too.the xs didn't look like a bag on me and could be dressed with a belt for a more fitted look. i like the knee length and fabric is super soft. definitely recommend!",4,1,0
118,39,Finally in my hands,"Delayed for a month on back order, this dress was worth the wait!  the beautiful design and colors are just as shown in the pictures.  the length and cut is slimming, more fitted at the bodice with a subtle flare after the waist.  detachable liner dress is a stetchy tank top that goes to the knees.  pullover style with a closed-end side zip that's needed because the knit band design under the bust does not stretch at all.

118,39,Perfect winter dress,"I love the texture and sheen of corduroy combined with this beautiful evergreen color. i purchased size 10 and the somewhat stretchy fit accommodates my bust size (36dd) with a blouse or slim fitting sweater quite well. i think the skirt flares out too much and ends a little too low for my height, so i'm waiting for the petite to arrive to see if it's more flattering. i picked tts but may be a bit large for those who are less busty, so you may want to size down if you're slender or pear shaped.",5,1,4

118,41,Beautiful dress!,"I'm super happy with this dress! it's extremely well made, very light and comfortable and the shoulder cutouts are tastefully done. this dress is cotton but doesn't look cheap or too casual; it's one of those rare finds that will look great dressed up or down. this will absolutely work across seasons, with leggings and boots/booties or bare legs and sandals when spring comes around. i do feel like it runs a little large, but again it's 100% cotton so i know there will be some shrinking when wash",5,1,14

i did size down on this one, but i didn't have to. that depends on the kind of fit you are looking for. sizing down did make the shirt more form fitting in my chest area, but also did make the garment somewhat less comfortable in the armpit area for being tighter (but not too tight). my normal size would have alleviated this problem, but also would have left the shirt with not a whole lot of shape. i opted to have a little shape and deal with the fabric slightly digging into my",5,1,7

129,56,"Gorgeous, but...","Everything about this dress is beautiful except for the hemline. the color is beautiful; the old-fashioned, wispy femininity is beautiful. the dress probably could use something better at the waistline besides elastic, maybe ribbons to tie, but the hemline is what kills it. it is half a normal-length dress (in the front) and half maxi dress (in the back). the designer should have chosen one or the other, not both, and it would have been much better. for the category of aesthetic/design, i would",4,0,17
129,56,Nicely styled with great fabric & pattern,"Love the pattern & fabric. it does run a little large. i usually take a medium or large but with this dress, i may have even taken a small. it is somewhat drapey, which i like, but that needs to be considered when sizing for it. i'm hoping it shrinks a tad so the dress has a bit more shape. i'd exchange it, but i love the pattern & quirky sleeves so much i want to keep it! got this gem on sale & can't wait to wear it in the spring & summer months next year (or maybe on a warm vacation)...",4,1,0

129,57,Big disappointment!,"I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it, but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider, more well-defined waist, with just a small amount of ""blousing"" on top, but this was not the case. yes, the waist fit, but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top, turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly, this is going right back!",1,0,31
129,57,Love!,"I found this dress to run true to size. i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs and the xs fits great. perfect length and i like the thicker fabric so it's not see through. the raw edges lend a cool laid back and the final embroidery is a perfect bohemian touch. wearing mine with a turquoise choker. awesome dress!",5,1,0

it went well with her perhaps because she saved a lot of her fashion from 1980s.
it also fit well with contemporary fashion as well.

140,41,Va va voom!,"Great skirt! i bought the red and paired it with a casual white button down. i feel like the top definitely needs to be short or tucked in for the look to work. i am typically a 2 in bottoms, and went with the small in this. the xs probably fits more like it's intended to, but it is very curve-hugging, and i was more comfortable with the looser fit of the small (especially since i am tucking in a blouse). there is stretch in the skirt, and the fabric has a nice feel.",5,1,0

the color is vivid and beautiful. i loved the buttons down the back. 
i usually wear a size small but they only had an extra small. i tried it on and liked the way it fit. i wanted a snugger look. i think the small would have worked too, just a looser feel.

142,27,"Really soft, great jacket. not navy blue","Tried it on in store, it's more of a cornflower blue instead of a true navy. if you zoom in you'll also notice there's a pattern to it. i think it gives it a little something extra. i may put gold buttons on it as the plain black buttons are a little boring. 

 didn't buy it right away and came back with a survey coupon and it was out of stock. had them order and free-ship it to me from the store.

the style is great and it has a peplum that goes all the way around the back. very different.

142,29,Thrilled to own this,"I'm short, only 5ft and this is beautiful and flowy. it's just below my knees and i think it's perfect. i have only worn it twice out and literally everywhere i went i received a compliment, and asking where i got it. it's unique and no one else carries one like this. i know some customers mentioned the price being a bit high but i disagree. i would rather pay for something that i love, that has good design and quality instead of 50 or 60 for a so so product. that's what i love about retailerpolog",5,1,1

i took a gamble and, for the most part, it paid off. i do like the jacket's unique bohemian gone chic/uptown styling and the gorgeous patten with a spattering of embroidery on the chest and back. what i don't like is the mix of black leather trim and big brass studs. i feel like there might be one too many ideas, or they could have been toned",4,1,0

142,35,Great summer jacket,I bought this jacket in white specifically for summer. it is the perfect weight for the office air conditioning coolness. i wore this jacket with a sleeveless silk blouse and summer skirt. it just looked perfect for a dressier summer outfit. i take a m/l in retailer jackets and went with the large in this because i have a large bust (36d). the medium fit but was just a tad snug through my upper back/front area. the large gave me a little wiggle room so i could wear a little heavier blouse undernea,5,1,16
142,35,Just ok,"I ordered two of these, the grey and ivory. i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer. these were the exception. i just could not pull them off. the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy. i do have wider hips. maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin? for reference, i am 5'6 and about 138lbs. i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me, the style was just off. i had to return both.",3,0,1

142,50,"Lovely piece, very pricey","I am still on the fence with this one. i got it sort of as an impulse buy when i was buying some tops at my local store the other day. the piece is gorgeous and looks great over a black tank top. it is very versatile in that you can wear it so many different ways; as an accent piece over a t-shirt, bathing suit cover up, over a dress. it is a delicate material so i'm sure you have to be careful washing it, but it has a feminine, flowy style that is very unique. the only thing that i'm not sure o",4,1,26

142,67,So disappointing,"I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first, the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono, which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve, no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu",1,0,7

147,61,Adorable top,"This is a cute top, especially the material design. i like tops that go over my bottom and this does. if i had a problem it is with the sizing. the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get. some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size. i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big. but i still love the overall look. i am also petite which is what i ordered.",4,1,0

148,32,Nice but stiff,"This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut, but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me, so had to go back.",3,0,0
148,32,Perfect for summer,"I want to address that with lightweight but not too skimpy for the summertime, and the stress works perfectly. i got the red in a small, and although one reviewer said that she did not like that the top and bottom are two different materials i actually think it's super cute. not sure if i would pay the full price, but the 20% off sale made it worth it.",5,1,9
148,32,So perfect...except that zipper,I ordered online. i sized up one size. it fit perfect. so flattering and so pretty. then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck...badly. 30 minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back. the zipper is that awful.,2,0,2
148,32,You need this!,"Rompers are my fav so i'm biased writing this review. although they are a little tricky with the fit i definitely can say that this beauty makes my body look amazing! the cut of the fabric makes for a great shape. yes, the first couple of buttons  are tough to get on but i'm guessing that after a couple of wears it will get easier. i got my usual size 4 and it fit like it was made specifically for me. i'm very happy with this purchase.",5,1,1
148,32,,Very comfy! can wear the dress both ways! the front is a deep swoop neck cut. the back is a v-neck cut. i flipped the dress around to the v-neck was more flattering on me due to having a smaller chest. got an size 4.,5,1,0
148,33,Beautiful design and construction,"I ordered this dress in a size 2, it puckered at my lower back. i am still so disappointed in the fact that i really wanted the navy option in this dress, that i chose to ultimately return it instead of exchange for a 4. it is truly gorgeous though, the black and pink just does not compliment my complection.",4,1,0

148,33,Beautifully made dress,"I am 5'4, 34b, 106lbs and the 0 fit me perfectly. it comes just above my knee so i could also have worn the petite and would have been fine if it was shorter too. i rarely wear green but this shade is so pretty.",5,1,0
148,33,Elegant and fun,Bought this dress for my boho bridal shower and loved it! it was perfect for the season and fit like a charm. i normally wear a 4-6 and needed the 2 so heads up that they run a little big.,4,1,0
148,33,Fun way to floral up the closet!,Looks cute on! not super form fitting... more of a flow fit. love the detailed stitching! so cute! floral pattern is fun not too busy! i loved the pockets... there is a bit of extra material but if you expect a flowy fit it's still totally lovely! i was worried about tightness in the arms but not a problem at all!!! i love this dress! lining makes it feel really well made!,4,1,0

148,33,Great for somebody with less jelly belly,"Either this rouching is going to accentuate your waist or it's going to accentuate the fact that you just had a baby and ate too much linguini. unfortunately i have 10 more pounds to go and sadly this dress pointed that out.

that said, i had to give it five stars all around because it's good quality, design, etc.. it'll be great but not for me. 

got a medium and it fit nicely (with the exception of pointing out that i still have baby belly to lose)-- 5'3, 34d, 150 pounds. hope this was hel",5,1,4
148,33,Great summer dress,"I tried this on in store and was very close to purchasing, but ultimately decided against it because it was too in between causal and dressy to me. i couldn't imagine where i would wear the dress. it was great quality and the green color was very pretty on. you could find a way to wear a bra with the dress.",4,1,0

148,33,Pretty dress,"I got this dress in the navy blue and it fits perfect. there is a little too much fabric in the middle, but it allows the dress the stretch more. the fabric on the button is a little thin and not lined, but you really can't see anything through it. i'm 5'2"" and usually purchase the petite, but the regular fit just fine and hit me about mid knee. the petite would have probably been too short.",5,1,1
148,33,Too large,"The dress is too big. i got size 4, after checking the measurements chart (for reference: 5'7"", 125 lb). it is too wide, not as fitted as in the picture. the cut is too deep (might work better for a bustier lady, but looks pathetic on me). 

the pattern is too bright, much brighter that in the picture (i got red pattern). it's not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately, it's just... the colors are much more vibrant in real life.

the material is heavier than i expected.",3,0,0

148,34,A must buy!!,"I tried this dress on and felt amazing in it.  i got home and showed my husband my purchases.  i told him i wasn't sure if i should have bought this one and told him to be honest with me.  he said it looked great and he was glad i bought it.  so great for a spring wedding. fits true to size.  i am 125 5'4"" c-cup and i bought my normal size 0.  this made my waist look really small.",5,1,0

148,34,Cute and easy,Beautiful dress that is easy to just throw on and go. i bought both colors. though it is loose it is still flattering. it has a good length and movement. i'm normally a m/l or 10/12. i took a medium as it is pretty loose fit.,5,1,0
148,34,Dotted fleur dress - black,"Absolutely love this dress. maeve dresses have always been constructed with great care and quality. i am and always have been a size med in maeve dresses. the dress is soft and flowing. the fabric is very forgiving and moves with you. i recommend trying on a dress by this maker . . . their cuts are consistent, so i feel extremely confident in buying their clothes online. this is a keeper and can be worn year round.",5,1,0
148,34,Extremely soft and comfortable,"I saw this in the sales rack and decided to try it on, and i'm so glad i did. it looks very ordinary on the hanger, but, in fact, it's a very surprising find, as others have mentioned.
_____________
pros:
- a-line so you could go down a size for a slimmer fit.
- the zipper in the back has an attached pleather-like tag to help in zipping the dress up. i found this extremely considerate and smart; most dresses don't have this.
- lots of stretch and very, very comfortable. i can see myself wearing",4,1,1
148,34,Great day dress,"I loved wearing this outside on a hot day! the fabric is a nice quality. you can't tell in the photos, but it is a jersey/knit fabric. the color labeled red that looks orange is actually coral. it's a nice color. i usually wear a true size 2, and that's what i ordered, but i found that it is slightly big. i can wear it, but would have preferred half a size to a full size smaller. a versatile dress that you can wear often!",4,1,0
148,34,Great dress!,"I really love this dress. it's very flattering for all body types - i'm 5'4"", 120 and i purchased a small. it also looks really cute with a stretchy belt. in the picture - it doesn't show this, but it has these cute snap sleeves that adds some great detail. it's also very comfortable. it is a thin material, so for those looking for a thicker fabric - this may not be the right dress. loved it!",5,1,6
148,34,Love this dress!,"I'm not sure why this dress has such bad online reviews because i absolutely love it! it fit tts for me, but i have a large bust so will run big if you are smaller on top. i don't like paying full price usually, but the quality and beauty of this dress justified it! if you are into prints and colors, you will definitely be able to pull it off :)",5,1,5

the material is nice but since it is not lined, it feels inexpensive, disposable.",3,0,5
148,34,The dress has nice fabric.,"I ordered a 6 and it fit great i am 5ft 3"" and 130lbs 34b in the chest! i love the fabric, i was drawn to it because i don't think it will wrinkle and crease as easily as other fabrics. it is a flattering cut and is very beautiful in person. the embroidery makes the dress unique.",4,1,6
148,35,Cute dress but sticky zipper,"I ran into retailer today and was very excited to see this dress since i had liked it online but wanted to be able to try it on based on reviews. it does run small for maeve.  typically with maeve a 2 fits better on me but i can always wear a 4. in this dress the 4 just fit. it is darling. i got the red and i love the fabric detail and stitched detail. however, the zipper is awful! no way around it, terrible! when i went to try this on at the store the zipper split just opening it to try th",4,1,7

148,35,Great for work,My local store offered this dress in a navy colorway with sky blue and pink embroidery. tried it on and fell in love! it fits well while being comfortable. my favorite part is the skirt - perfect flirty a-line. already bought matching cardigans and can't wait to wear this to work. so perfect for spring!,5,1,40
148,35,Perfect,"This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10"" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles, it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!",5,1,0
148,35,Runs a little big for hd,"Agree with other reviewers : this dress is surprisingly nice weight/quality fabric. it's also very swingy. i find i am usually a size 10 in hd in paris items (m in deletta and s/m in meadow rue, for comparison) since i'm a 34d i find hd in paris items to leave too little room for larger busts so i size up. in this dress i'm going to try for the m, since the l i ordered was too big, the swingyness leaves lots of room if you are an hourglass shape and the sleeves were roomy without being too big.",4,1,0
148,35,Super score,"This is such a great work wear piece for me. it's form flattering, well constructed, comfortable and truly elegant. this is probably my 5th or 6th dress from the moulinette soeurs line and i am consistently impressed with the quality and wearability of these clothes.

148,36,A winner!,"What a well-designed dress! the cut is a slight a-line without adding bulk and the pattern is very slimming. the lining makes this a pretty good option for cooler weather. the neck is pretty wide, as others have noted, but i find that a heavy cream colored scarf is a pretty good accent. it does run a little large. i'm 5'5""/130lbs and went with the xsp.",5,1,6

2- i found that it ran large. i've lost some weight recently, so perhaps i've gone down a size, but the medium was like a sack on me.

160,66,Underwhelmed,"I stalked this blouse and when the price dropped, i pounced on the black. sadly, it did nothing for me. i'm a large, sometimes medium, but decided on the large. you'd think it came with its own cami at this price, but no. completely sheer. unwearable without one. the lace is nothing special. the collar is wider in the back, uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front. the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back. i'm returning this one.",3,1,2

163,42,,"Love ag jeans!! a little on the pricey side...but so worth it. the harper style is just enough higher wasted so i can actually bend over and not worry about anyone seeing anything other than my jeans :) but not too high waisted. these jeans keep their shape still with a little strestch to them. i am 5'5,, and 111 lbs and if not wearing under boots would have to a0 alter or b) wear as these are in the picture because they'd be too long for me. but i would purchase these all over again. love these",5,1,2
163,43,"Fun, flattering","The high/low hem is interesting, and the fit looks great. i did find that i needed one size larger than normal.  maybe that's bc these are high rise?  there is also absolutely no stretch in the fabric.",4,1,2
163,44,Ag fan!,I'm super happy with the way these jeans fit. i typically buy ag jeans for fit and quality. this pair is extremely comfy with the right amount of stretch yet still somewhat relaxed. they do run a big large so i sized down and they still fit great... lots of compliments!,5,1,0

163,44,Great pair of jeans!,I wear a 10/12. i bought a 30/31 and they fit perfect in every way! they were even almost too long so i can wear with heels if i want. i am so glad i bought these. don't let the folded cuff in the picture deceive you. a great pair of straight leg jeans!,5,1,2

163,47,The perfect pair of jeans,"The perfect pair. i am 5'6"". 130lb, and ordered size 28, and it fits just right. it is a little stretchy, so molds to your shape. the legs are slender, but not too fitted. no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt.",5,1,3
163,48,Very stretchy fabric has fit issues...,"I love the color and cut of the pants. they are more a dark indigo twill than a jean, to be sure. a fit issue is how the front pockets pop out because of the excessive stretchiness of the fabric. i wear them and love them, but stitched the front pockets closed to avoid the unflattering pop-out pockets.",4,1,3

163,53,Winner!,"I love ag jeans. these jeans fit snug but not confining. they have some stretch to the material so that you can move with ease. i love the way they fit my body with one exception. unfortunately they did not have the petite available so the length is about 3 to 4 inches too long on my 5'3 frame. the dark blue makes it acceptable for casual friday (yay). i am 5'3 102lbs and even though i will have to hem them, the overall fit was great!",5,1,0

164,24,Gorgeous dress,"This dress is beautiful. i ordered this in the mail and literally said ""wow"" when i took it out of the packaging. the color looks more like champagne in person and the flowers look fantastic on it. i was worried that it might look a little awkward with so many things hanging off, but instead the flowers really compliment the entire ensemble. it really just looks like a work of art. i'm usually a small in retailer clothes and that size fits me very well. i absolutely love this dress.",5,1,1
164,24,Great dress overall,"This dress was overall cute, but you have to have an olive/darker complexion or a nice tan to really pull it off because it is such a pale pink. i'm very fare, but normally can do light punks, but this one just clashed. it does run pretty true to size. if you're on the edge between a smaller or bigger size, i recommend the smaller size however. hope this helps y'all!",4,1,0

164,33,"Stylish, versatile dress","I ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening. after seeing the other reviews i wasn't sure about it, but i was very pleased when it arrived. i find it is elegant and sexy, but also modest enough when i sized up by 1. i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly. it is form-fitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight. i'm excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace.",5,1,3
164,33,,"I got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it. the color is a beautiful rich red, which was a nice surprise. i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture. love the fabric - soft and appears to be good quality. the length is perfect - hit right at my knees (size small). the flow of the dress is great as well. the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes. the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck - almost like it was on",2,0,4
164,34,Beautiful plaid material,I seriously wanted to cry when this dress didn't fit me. i knew ordering it that it was a long shot. i'm a 36d and strapless rarely works. this was no different. the dress ran true to size and it is precious!,4,1,0
164,34,Greek goddess-style not for all!,"If you have any curves, avoid! it is not flattering.
the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress.",1,0,0
164,34,Hard one to review,"I had a really, really difficult time reviewing this dress. the instant i touched it, i wanted to love it! in theory, it should have worked for me. fit and flare is usually a really great option for my pear shape. the silhouette shows off my thinner upper body and camouflages my thicker lower body. best of both worlds! however, as you can see for yourself in the photo, this dress makes me look pretty big. i'm a solid size 8 and i feel this dress makes me look like a 12. it really makes my middle",3,1,6
164,34,Snug and unflattering,"Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste. 
i'm 5'7"" and 140. this landed mid calf. not my preference. 

retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it.",2,0,0
164,34,Super cute,I loved this dress so much i got it in 2 colors. i had to send it back twice to get the size right. i ended up with a medium. the fabric was pretty wrinkly on arrival. it is dryclean only. overall it is an easy and relaxed dress appropriate for work but still very cute.,5,1,0
164,34,Will get lots of wear!,"I tried this on in the store in a medium by accident, thinking that it was a large. i loved it even though the front was way too short on me and the elastic waist was way too tight. the store didn't have the next size up and after reading the other reviews i decided to order my standard xl online. its a keeper! i am plus sized and have an ample mid section and this was still flattering on me. i plan to wear it with a black duster sweater, leggings, and boots all winter long and then when the wea",5,1,2
164,35,Chic dress,Very happy with this online dress purchase! it fits tts and i love the ruching. i've already gotten compliments on it!,5,1,0
164,35,Elegant and well made,This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.,5,1,3
164,35,Great bra-less option,"I literally bought this dress 2 days ago and now it is listed as ""no longer available"" on the retailer site. i am a size 12 with about a 36b-c bust. the thing i love about this dress is that it looks really nice without a bra. i was really surprised at how well constructed it was.",5,1,3
164,35,Huge,"I knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant...i even bought a small even though i normally wear medium
i bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks.
it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works",3,1,0
164,35,Hugs curves,"This is a very fitted dress. i love it and it is very comfortable but might only be appropriate for date night as it really hugs curves. there is a lining of the same material underneath that holds you in a little. i think it could go with a lot of different shoes and you could dress it up or down with jewelry, jacket, even a large sweater over the top. tts. i definitely would not recommend sizing down! i'm a 8/10 and the med is right for me.",5,1,0
164,35,I sized down and the fit is perfect.,"Let me start by saying i was not in the market for a new dress. i bought this because it was retailer day and because in my seasoned experience as an online shopper this many positive reviews is rare so i'd better listen up. and because i really like the other bailey 44 dress i own. wow! i am glad i made the impulse decision to buy this. i love it, my husband loves it and it's comfy. for reference i did size down and went with a petite. had i not i think the dress would look on me like it does on",5,1,5
164,35,Nice casual dress,"Cute, casual dress -- i especially love the thick fabric, as i think it will hold up well. the fit is slightly boxy, but it's short enough for it not to matter as much, and the waist tie helps give the dress a little shape. i was surprised that the the petite xs was off for me proportionally (usually i wear petite sizing at retailer) but the regular xs fit much better.",4,1,0
164,35,Runs big,"Beautiful dress, but works best with a belt where the dress cinches at the high waist. it runs huge: i'm 5'6 and a m/l but the small petite is what looks and fits the best. there is a lot of unnecessary fabric and stretch at the waist. i received a lot of compliments on this dress! glad i kept trying on smaller sizes.",4,1,0
164,35,Talk about flattering,"How could this not be flattering to every figure? bunching of fabric is awesome at hiding imperfections (i know, i have become a master at hiding some of my residual baby weight for years now). this, paired with a darker color (and not black, yay!) makes for a perfect combination in a dress. i love that this is a deep purple, it is a dark color which is slimming, but in addition it has more appeal being colored. and it is so versatile! wear it along or with a cardigan/jacket on top. heels or boo",5,1,4

164,36,Cozy and versatile,"I really love how comfortable and versatile this dress is. the midi length is perfect for booties or flats, and the cowl neck is loose and fluid, so it lays well. the only complaint i had, and it's minor, is the tulip skirt doesn't stay closed well when i walk or sit, which reveals more inner thigh than i am comfortable showing. i have to be very mindful of the skirt all day (i teach high school).",4,1,0
164,36,Great dress!,"Wow. i just love this dress. it hangs beautifully and is such a great length. shoulder straps adjustable, simple button closures in back. i wore it dressed up a bit with a sweater and then again more causal without. i got it on sale so it fit even better!! :)",5,1,1
164,36,Perfect for everyone!!!!,"I love this dress!!! it's comfortable, flattering and stylish. looks great with flats or boots - awesome with a chunky scarf and tights.",5,1,0
164,36,Very loose,"I love the look of this dress & had high hopes, but it didn't live up to them. have no doubt that it is well made & beautiful, fully lined with lovely detailing around the neck. i am 5'6"", 155lbs with a postpartum belly that i'd like to hide, so i chose this dress as the reviews say it's a bit loose & forgiving. i found it to be so loose that it looks big & entirely hides my figure! i considered ordering a small, but knew that it was simply the cut of the dress & going down a size wouldn't chang",3,0,4
164,36,,"As a busty but small-waisted girl, i normally would not wear a loose shift like this. however, it turned out to be perfect for hiding my early/mid pregnancy belly. the dress is extremely comfortable, and it will also come in handy in the postpartum months. in fact, it looks so cute that i might just add it to my regular wardrobe after all.",5,1,0

164,37,Uneven reviews - but i love it,"I'm torn on how to review this dress. 

i bought it in a lovely slate grey (which doesn't appear to be available now). it drapes cleanly and is extremely comfortable. it has also proven extremely versatile through weight and body changes. i bought a small and am 5'9"", and am typically ~130 lbs with a very long waist. i wore it through early pregnancy and now love it because i can nurse my newborn comfortably and it still nicely fits my ~150 lb frame. 

the problem is that my husband hates th",4,1,0
164,38,A total dud,"Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.

the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess. 

looking beyond that, i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders, but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also, front b",1,0,17
164,38,Big arm holes,"I tried this dress on in the store today, and the armholes were so wide, it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom, and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front. while the dress seems like it will be really comfy, the arm cuts are so unnatural, i had to pass. i did try going down in size, and petite, and neither of those options worked to fix the situation.",3,0,3
164,38,Disappointed,"This dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away. i am a size 4 petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit, if anything i might have to size down. i purchased a 4 petite in this dress and i couldn't zip it all the way up. it was as if i was trying to get into a 0 petite.  i don't even think a size 6 would fit. there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received. even if the fit was perfect i didn't",1,0,1
164,38,Go to dress,Perfect for a hot day and skins the body beautifully. so soft! i am usually a medium but got a small which fit perfect. usually swing dresses do not compliment the waistline but this one did!,5,1,0
164,38,Lightweight and flowy,"I love this dress so much, i've considered getting it in the other prints. it's fitted in all the right places and has pockets! i love that it's stretchy. i'm a 36d and it's hard to fit dresses over the chest. this dress is a dream!",5,1,44
164,38,Lovely plaid halter,I live abroad where there is no retailer. so i  rely heavily on reviews.i took the advice from others and ordered a size up.  glad i did because the top portion of the dress runs very small. if you have larger breasts this dress may not work for you. luckily for me..it fits wonderfully..i love the fabric and the fact that it has pockets. it's lined..but not too bulky.its a lovely summer halter where you can show a little skin.,5,1,1

164,38,Perfect summer dress,This dress is so beautiful on. purchased in black motif and it can definitely be dressed up or down. material is lightweight (perfect for summer) and the dress washed up beautifully in the washing machine. i always wear an xs in maeve and the dress fits true to size.,5,1,0

164,39,I like this one,"I tried on the xs in the store and decided to size down (and get xxs petite). it looked much better. the length was flattering, and as others mentioned, the bottom is nice and flowy. it is comfortable, and the orange color is flattering and i love the striped detail on the sides. good casual dress, but i can dress it up with a bejeweled belt. i am 115 lbs 30dd chest for xxs petite...",5,1,5
164,39,Material is amazing,"I am in love with this dress. it's super soft, flattering  and comfy i want to wear it everyday. it was recommended to me by a friend who is taller and slimmer than i am so i was skeptical of the fit. sometimes you see things that are only meant for models to wear. so not true here. i am 5'3"" 140 pounds with slightly broad shoulders and i bought an xs. i'm considering getting a second one.",5,1,0

flattering style, comfrotable fabric, really nice overall...",5,1,0
164,39,Not flattering on *me*,"I recommend this dress for people who do not have my body type. the dress is very comfortable and nicely designed. my torso is a bit barrel chested with a large bust so the fabric both wrapped and billowed out unattractively, causing the waistband to ride up and the skirt to pouf out over my tummy. if your body is more like the model, this is a flattering dress. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140# and ordered the medium petite. perhaps if i bought the non-petite version or sized down maybe it will",4,1,22
164,39,Not great if you're tall,"Comfortable and soft material, cute design and nice longer length..however, i'm long waisted and this looked ridiculous on my me, elastic came up right under my bra and not at my waist. would be cute for someone shorter.",3,0,1
164,39,Not what i expected,"I found this dress to run very large. the fabric was substantial but rather coarse. also, the lighter color in the pattern is lavender and not white or cream.",3,0,13
164,39,Perfection from dolan,How i did not notice this dress for weeks i do not know. this is absolutely the best casual dress i've ever had the pleasure of owning and i hope my future includes acquiring the other sold out colors. i was fortunate enough to buy the holly in m and taupe in mp and they both fit well and look flattering on my unproportioned body. this dress goes well with many layers or on its own and is going to work for at least three seasons in my area. the drape of the willa complements my over large upper,5,1,0

164,44,An almost for me...,"I didn't end up keeping this dress...it just wasn't right for me. it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin (partially lined which is a plus) and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me. i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slit/vent was just too high for my liking. the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 5'4"" (~118#). i guess i just didn't ""love"" it and would rather save my funds for something i ca",3,1,4

164,45,More beautiful than it looks!,"This dress is absolutely gorgeous! the colors are actually very bright. it has a little embroidery and beading in the chest area. the fabric is actually very soft and it comes with built in slip. i found that it runs true to size. i got a medium, as i wanted it to be more roomy. i'm planning to wear it with booties, long boots, or sandals in the spring. i think it will make a great teacher dress.",5,1,4
164,45,Not for the short-waisted,"This dress is sort of a mixed-media dress. the top colored portion is a slinky knit that dolan uses all the time. i like it a lot. the bottom, is a tight silky twill-like weave. the silhouette is straight, which is what attracted me to it, but when i put it on, i realized that the waist wasn't going to work for me. the split came at a point too high for me to belt and the sleeves made my wide shoulders look dowdy. i am not a person that wants to put on a dress and have to style the heck out of i",3,0,0

8's do...perfect... only one thing...it is not as short as it looks on this model. i am going to have to have it shortened...but that is not biggy. the skirt is everything i hoped t would be and i know i will wear it to death.",5,1,2
165,70,Versatile skirt,"Well made. color is great, goes from summer right into fall. looks good with sandles and will wear with boots later on. goes well with classic tee, denim shirt or plaid blouse. has a retro/ classic look.",5,1,1
165,72,Awesome skirt,I feel really cool wearing this skirt :-) a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform. loooks great with short boots. i'm wearing it as i write this review--and was wearing it all day. awesome skirt!,5,1,1
165,72,,"Very pretty fabric and beautiful color, but i agree with the other reviewer here, the fit is a bit strange. the waist is very small - need to size up at least one size for that to fit - while the rest fits nicely. it's also a little longer than i had expected...sort of looks like it should be a couple inches shorter (and i'm 5'11""!).",4,1,5

166,20,Absolutely lovely,"It fits perfectly, slim but not clingy, and it has a beautiful pattern/texture to it. its surprisingly warm for how thin it is and its a great layering piece.",5,1,0
166,20,Great light weight sweater,Great green color. drapes well. nice gray detailing adds dimension to an already pretty sweater.,5,1,0
166,22,Need to see this in person,"The photo does a disservice to this beautiful sweater it is truly special with a lace scallop pattern down the front and across to the back. it is absolutely beautiful!! the sweater is lightweight, perfect for a cool day or in an office on a cold day.. i snapped up the grey and may purchase the green if it goes on sale.(unless they can show this sweater off better i am certain it will.) i am usually right between a small and a medium and needed the medium in this sweater. the small was bit tight",5,1,2
166,23,Gorgeous,"I recently purchased this cardigan and got so many compliments the first day i wore it.  the detail is so exquisite, it will be worth every penny.",5,1,0
166,23,"Soft, cozy and perfect for the holidays","I love this piece because of its flattering stripes.i am 5' 9'', 150 lbs and ordered a medium. the large was just too big, the small too short and tight, but the medium fit well. however, the sleeves are a little large which was a disappointment, and because of this there's an awkward excess of fabric on the front next to the armpits. i also experienced that the shirt is not long enough to tuck in, how the model has done.",3,1,1
166,23,,"I am tall and this sweater is a great length. very flattering, slightly loose across the tummy. i have the red/mauve color and may order the gray too. super soft , medium weight sweater- very versatile. love",5,1,8
166,23,,Love the color. love the design. at the hem this top runs wide. i'm still deciding whether to keep this as i think the wide hem may be somewhat flattering on me.,4,1,0
166,24,Easy,"I first bought this top in the dark grey, loved it so much that i ordered the navy too! the quality is amazing as always, and fit is perfect (some may say it runs large, but i'm pretty sure it is meant to have a looser fit). i love the material of the lighter color blocked back. it's so versatile and easy to throw on. i've worn it simply with jeans, and i've also paired it with a pencil skirt and overlapping skinny belt and heels for a great work outfit (received compliments!).",5,1,0
166,24,Great sweater for the fall season,"I went to my local retailer store in kansas city,mo at country club plaza and let me tell you when i saw this sweater i mediately fell in love with it. i bought mine in the red color in a size medium and it fit me perfectly. i would definitely recommend getting this sweater because it's so soft and very flattering on my body type. i also love the pattern and definitely worth the money!!",5,1,5
166,24,,"I have a mixed feeling about this cardigan.
on one hand, i like it; on the other hand, there are some minor things i do not like.
first, i love its knit pattern; especially the pattern on the back.
second, i like a soft color of this cardigan.
on website pictures, two motifs look almost the same.
in reality, brown motif is light pink-ish while blue motif is light blue-green-ish.
third, texture.
this cardigan is made of linen and cotton, so it feels comfortable to wear.

i have broad shoulders and the small worked",5,1,2
166,25,Unique and cozy,"I was drawn to this sweater for its vibrant colours and unique pattern. i tried it on and immediately fell in love with the comfort, quality, and design. it is a little short, but this minor issue is easily fixed with by wearing a neutral colored undershirt/camisole. the cuffed sleeves reveal a matching pattern and can be rolled down or up. i usually wear a xs or s in retailer's clothes, but i sized up to a m on this one. definitely worth it. this is a festive winter piece that can be dressed up o",5,1,13
166,26,Great transitioning top,"It took me a while to finally try this on after seeing it in store for a while, i wasn't sure about the color. then i saw it matched with the brush stroke charlie trousers (which i had just purchased) and loved the combination so much i had to finally try it. i love the fit and feel of this top. i agree with a poster before that the photo does not do this top justice. my only wish is that t was a touch longer.",5,1,0
166,26,Just what i was hoping for,"I got this top on a fantastic deal - it is comfortable, fits well (slightly large to size, but i prefer that), and really on-trend. such a great staple i bought in the other colorway as well.",5,1,0
166,27,,Very pretty and has potential. only down side - i thought it was more like a cardigan with sleeves but it's really more of a shawl and the photos and descriptions are misleading,3,1,1
166,28,Amazing!,"Such a gorgeous weight, cut and style! the button detail is adorable and the fit of the sweater is fantastic. the hem style, (not sure what you would call it), is incredibly flattering for an hourglass figure. i am 5'4, 133 and 34dd. fit is tts, maybe a bit large but nothing crazy. love",5,1,0

166,28,Great cardigan,Love this cardigan. fits just as i expected. very structured in the front with a bit of flair in the back.,5,1,0
166,29,Beautiful and unique sweater,"I had purchased the black color of this sweater at full price and loved it so much that when i saw the burgundy color go on sale i knew i had to have it! this sweater is very comfortable and elevates any look with its lace down the sleeve, mock neck collar, and slightly flared silhouette. it's so fun to find different shirts to wear underneath to get a whole new look. highly recommend, would have gotten all colors!",5,1,0
166,30,Sent to me damaged,"I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed, because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived, it was sold out in my size. now, i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged, i would recommend this product.",2,1,0
166,31,Cozy / sleek but poor construction,"First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off.
i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.",3,1,15
166,31,Enormous,"I was really excited about this sweater, but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size, but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference, i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.",1,0,6
166,31,Loved so much i bought 2,"Not usually one for a turtleneck, even a mock turtleneck, but this so soft and did not fit super tight around the neck so i bought it. then i bought the other one because i loved it so much. my only gripe is that i wish it was a smidge longer. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic build, 34c and the small fit perfect.",5,1,11
166,31,,,5,1,0
166,32,Awesome sweater,"Love, love, love this sweater. it is so comfy and well made. this is a piece i will have for a very long time. the beautiful lace detail are the sleeves are to die for. picture doesn't do this sweater justice.",5,1,0
166,32,Better in person!,"I was swayed to buy this via the reviews on the site -- and they are all correct! it is a beautiful piece. i got the ""brown"" colored one, but it is pretty much exactly the color in the picture, more of a khaki. 

it is a gorgeous sweater. the sleeves are very long, but easy to push up if they're too much for you. it is also very long, which i prefer but on shorter gals it may be overwhelming. it's a perfect shell for cooler summer nights and it dresses up a basic outfit.",4,1,0
166,32,Deliciously soft,This sweater is gorgeous. ordered in the grey motif. was as described and wonderfully soft. i tried it on with just a tank top underneath and did not find the material scratchy at all. i ordered the small size and felt it ran a tad on the large side however not enough to feel like i needed to return for an xs. looking forward to the colder months!,5,1,0
166,32,Great shirt for work,This top is really comfortable but dressy enough for a business/casual office. the fit is nice and loose without making you look larger than you are. i get a lot of compliments every time i wear this.,5,1,0
166,33,"Easy, cute sweater","I just picked this up today in the store and i have to say i really love it! on the site i thought it was just ""meh"" but in person the space dye is interesting and the seam detail make the sweater better than i expected. it definitely runs large, i sized down to an xs (usually a s, size 4/6) and it's still slouchy and comfortable without looking sloppy, the dolman sleeve gives you plenty of room in the chest and the neck isn't at all tight. it's soft and just an overall cute sweater!",5,1,1
166,33,So soft,"I happened upon this one in store in my xs size. online it would not catch my eye, but in person i love it. it fits like a glove and is so soft and elegant with the knit detailing, pleats, and length in the back. i couldn't pass this one up. i also agree with the other reviewers about colors:/",5,1,0
166,33,So very pretty,"This is such a classy, elegant and interest piece for your wardrobe. the fabric and cut is lovely and it drapes really nice. i love how it doesn't slide around on your frame when you move and the pockets are awesome - such a fun and practical extra. i thought the arms were a little tricky - but you would see the same issue with any cape style top. the gray is a nice color, but i wish it came in another option - a wine color would be amazing.",5,1,1
166,33,Strange fit,"The pattern and fabric are lovely, but the sleeves are short (unlike the photo) so it drapes very strangely. i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo. had to return this one.",2,0,1
166,34,Beautiful and bright,I love the color of this cardigan and the cashmere is very soft. i love the detail in the stitching and how the zipper is covered. i do wish it were a bit longer but it's definitely a keeper.,5,1,0
166,34,Perfect lightweight sweater!,I've worn this twice now and got a ton of compliments on it. it's so comfortable and looks great. the lavender color is gorgeous. highly recommend.,5,1,1
166,34,Sparkly sweater,It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin,2,0,0
166,34,Uniquely designed shawl,"I purchased this online because i just loved the gorgeous designs and embroidery. it has a unique cut to it as it has wrist holes but is otherwise open. i have a difficult time keeping it from falling off of my shoulders when i wear it over bear skin. i hope it will stay in place when i wear it over long sleeves or a sweater. overall i am happy with it, but i think it may run small as it hits the model at her wrists but hits me above my elbow. i am not very tall or long-limned so it seems strang",4,1,1

166,35,Comfortable but not flattering,"I really like the color of this and the feel, but that is where it ends. it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with, and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves. i could purchase the belt with it, but i don't prefer to purchase products that cannot stand on their own.",3,0,2
166,35,Don't think twice,This structured sweater is beautiful and timeless! gorgeous seasonal color and style is classic! i typically order medium but wanted a more flowy look and got a large. great purchase. great fit!,5,1,7
166,35,Fabulous fabulous fabulous,"This is a perfect sweater. it's comfortable, practical and lends an elegant hand to a pair of jeans. it also hides your bits and stays flattering. i have worn it a lot because it makes life so easy and i have not had any issues yet with lace tearing.

166,35,Great gift,I ordered two of these in orange as holiday gifts this year. both were loved! great style and quality will hopefully make this a go-to sweater for both recipients.,5,1,0
166,35,Nice lightweight sweater,I caught this on sale and bought the light pink version. it is very lightweight and delicate. i must admit on taking it out of the box i was a little concerned at the shape / design- but once i tried it on i found it draped beautifully and was really a good buy. it is very unique and i think i could wear it with nice slacks for work or keep it more casual with jeans and a t-shirt on the weekend. the only drawback is that the material is not what you would expect from a sweater- it does feel more,4,1,0
166,35,"Nice shirt, wrong body type","This shirt is beautiful, however i thought that it was made of a softer, lighter material. it is, instead, made of a thick, heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly, i'll be returning",3,1,0
166,35,Not for me...,"On me, this top is totally frumpy and boxy. i am 5'9, 34dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt. not fitted at all. i ordered a large--not being sure of fit. i have a flat stomach and it just hung....yuck. honestly, for the price and fit, i wouldn't consider a medium. i think it would a tad better but not worth the price.",2,0,4
166,35,Not for tall ladies,"This sweater is a cute design but did not work for me. i am 5'9"" and this is way to short/cropped and looks awkward. the quality was so so, it looked stretched out in the front. it's getting returned.",2,0,1
166,35,Not for the full-busted,"This top looks great on the model -- a petite frame, small-busted body.  i am 5'2"" and have a large bust and curvy hips. this top hit in all the wrong places. the front looks very cropped and frumpy, if you have a large bust. the width of the top of very boxy.  the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty.",2,0,0
166,35,So in love!!,"I am normally a pretty big fan of the moth brand, but i took a chance on this dress/tunic and i am so glad i did! i love love love this piece. it's soft, light weight material make t perfectly versatile so spring, winter and fall. it's so easy to throw on with a pair of leggings or skinny jeans and dress up or down with a scarf or necklace. i've already worn it several times and wearing it right now actually! it fits very true to size, i am 36d, 31"" waist and 5' 2"" so i ordered a large and it fi",5,1,0

166,36,"Good fabric quality, poorly shaped","I agree with the other reviewers; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist, in an unflattering way. the rest of it was beautiful though. looks too much like maternity, even in a petite xs, so it's going back.",3,0,1

166,36,Just what i needed!,"I recently noticed that my trusty black cardigan, that i've had for years, was getting thin in the elbows and just kind of ragged, so out i went on the long journey to find the perfect cardigan with detail. this cardigan fit the bill, with a perfect fit and lovely texture, making it not just your average sweater, to go with my style. can't say anything bad about it!",5,1,1
166,36,Nice cardi,"I wish i had sized up on this one. you can't tell from the photo, but has kind of a weird taper thing where the sides are shorter than the back. the back is extremely flatteringly, but the front... not so much. the shorter sides are a little awkward. there is no attached way to fasten this cardigan, and it lays kind of strange. the material is a medium thickness and i think will be very versatile. very soft, of course. i got the blue/ teal color. i found the color to be true to the color on-line",4,1,3
166,36,Works for small frames,"Purchased this sweater in an xs, grey pattern (for reference, 5'4"", small frame) and was worried it would be too overwhelming. this is not the case! the pattern is the perfect scale and the sweater hit just right. it seems to be true to size. i especially love the bracelet length turned back sleeves. it's a little pricey, but i think it will be worth it because it is so different!",5,1,0
166,36,,"This sweater is so lovely, i bought it first in navy and then came back for it in grey. very soft and comfortable. the back doesn't wrinkle the way you might think it would from the pics alone. very flattering. i highly recommend it!",5,1,0

166,37,Cute but wearable?,"This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however, i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning, it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.",3,0,5
166,37,Not what i'd hoped,"I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge, because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings. i'm 5'9"", so i got the m/l to ensure length. maybe that was wrong? if the ""laid flat width"" was included maybe that would have been more helpful, but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack. the side slits (of course hidden in the photos) came up to just over my natural waist, enhancing that effect. i loved the",2,0,29

166,38,Prettier in person,"I first saw this online and was worried the design might look awkward in real life...not on a model, but tired it on in store and it looks great!  it has a tighter fit and seems to flair out in just the right place.  just the right thickness, not too thin or thick.  i am 5'6"", 124lb, 34b and got the xs.  i did not try on the s for comparison as i thought the xs fit great.  i'm always either an xs or s with retailer tops. blue is definitely more steel. interesting piece! will not disappointed!",5,1,0

166,83,Very cute top but runs large,"I ordered this top in all 3 colors, love the peplum.look..
returned the green, which is actually my fav color but it wasn't a pretty shade of green and i don't think that it was a flattering contrast with the cream,, especially going into spring/summer..
kept the yellow and the navy and love..
the navy is classic and the yellow is soft and flattering.

167,29,Great casual dress to throw on,"I ordered a petite medium in black, and it fit great great. some of the other reviews said it was tight, but i found it pretty loose and flowy. also felt it was plenty of coverage - wore it to work (casual workplace) and transitioned to happy hour beautifully.",4,1,2

167,40,Luxurious sleepwear,"This is a very comfortable and sexy sleep dress, the way it drapes. i can see that the type of fabric is not suitable for out and about activities and can catch on snags, etc. very easily. once i relegated it to the nightgown category it became my favorite item to wear and lounge in.",4,1,0
167,69,Overpriced but so comfortable,This is a great beach/pool or lounge piece. i debated keeping but couldn't pass up how comfortable it was. hugging without being tight. i will probably only wear it with some sort of layer like a jean jack or tied shirt rather than undone unless on on the beach but it's so comfortable. straps are a bit long.,4,1,12

168,23,Comfortable & lovely,"This dress is incredibly soft, comfortable, and essentially lined (i mean, look at all that intricate embroidery... your skin has no idea it is there). the colors are lovely (the embroidery is sort of a soft peachy cream lined with gold) and the dress is even prettier in person. the neckline is low, but not too revealing, and, though i normally avoid shirts without sleeves, the cut is flattering around my arms. the cut of the hem is also flattering. in some ways, the belt seems like an extra pie",5,1,1
168,26,Beautiful,"I love this dress, although the darting is terrible. the colors are much richer in person, it's a beautiful dress for events and has a nice weight so it doesn't feel too flimsy (since it is not lined). i really love the length of the sleeves and the swish of the skirt. however, the darting makes your bust have two little triangles- i really wish i could reseam the darting as it's a bit strange looking.",4,1,0

168,36,Pretty dress but oddly cut in the middle,"This dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter. it is well made and the details are pretty. however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape, so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach. i wear a size l or 10 in dresses at retailer, and it just did not flatter my body type at all. for a thinner, narrow silhouette, i suppose it would look better, like it does on the model. i had to return it.",4,0,6

169,40,Worth every penny!,"Walked in intending to purchase another jacket and ended up leaving with this one. the color is advertised as grey, but it's actually more like a light mocha. the slightly darker fabric on the side and around the waist accentuated my curves and i believe it would help give the illusion of an hourglass figure to those who are more straight and slender. i generally wear a size 12 and m or l size tops depending on the designer. i purchased the l in this case because that's all that was available at",5,1,6

it's long, i found it to be just below knee length (5'6"").
if you zoom in, you can see some detail work along the front edges which complements the pretty openwork in back.

169,46,Great tee for summer,I ordered the size xl and it fits me as it does on the model. it's true to size. it is made of a scratchier material but is still comfortable to wear. definitely needs a tank/cami underneath. i love the vintage look. it's worn well & washed well too. i'd love to see more versions in this same style. i'll get good use out of this in the summer and then will layer cardigans over it in the fall.,5,1,2

170,26,Better than it looks on the model,"This top was surprisingly very flattering. it hugged my curves in just the right way and the slits on the side are a nice touch. i'm 5'2"" and about a 34c and the xs was tight (in a good way) around my chest and then more flowy after. soft material and the red color is beautiful!",5,1,1
170,26,Warm weather winter,"This top is perfect for wanting that fall/winter look in warmer climates. the slits on the sides allow for a lot of movement and turtleneck is just right. i love wearing it with my paige bell canyon flairs and some clogs! my only thing i wish was that it was cut in so much at the top, as how you can see at the model's armpit, wish that part was a little wider it would be a bit more flattering. otherwise great top, i have it in black and been thinking about getting it in the orange color too!",5,1,0
170,27,Perfect shirt for all occasions,I absolutely love this top! i bought it in white and ended up buying it in the lavender as well. the top is very flattering and works with any occasion. the fabric is a little thin but its fine with a nude bra. i have worn the top to work and out at night and i always get lots of compliments!,5,1,1
170,28,Not sure who this would flatter,"Definitely agree with the other reviewers. this top looks great on the model, but pretty bad in real life. super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs. if you plan on ordering, i'd recommend sizing down.",2,0,0

170,31,Cute & comfy,"I had higher hopes for this top and thought it would be fanicer. but as a previous reviewer mentioned, the quality of the material and elastic waistband makes the top look a little cheaper in person. i'm glad i got it on sale with the extra 25% off.

i was hoping to exchange it for a small, but it's sold out by now. the top runs a little large. normally i'm between a small and a medium, but i think a small might even be too big. i put it on this morning in the dark and by the time i got to work",4,1,0

170,33,Cute peplum tank without being frumpy,"I bought this tank on a whim without trying it on in the store, in black. the detail on the front is cute and the peplum is really cute without being frumpy at all. i am usually a small, ocassionally a medium in retailer shirts and i bought this in small. it fits but i feel like i could have gone up to a medium, it's just a little tight across the chest, but i do have more broad shoulders than most so maybe it's just because of that. the fabric is nice and stretchy, so i might be able to get away",5,1,14

170,34,Great blouse,"Love this top, purchased it in the coral color now i'm definitely wanting it in the blue since it is such a great blouse for transitioning into fall. the weight of the top it good since i live in south texas so definitely needing lightweight long sleeves for our weather. i'm sure when the time comes adding a long cardigan or blazer over it as needed for the cooler weather it will look great. fit true to size.",5,1,0

pros:
- breathable and comfortable fabric due to cotton/linen blend.

170,35,,Just bought the patterned and gray. the small fit perfect. i do have a short torso though. chest size 32dd. i tried the medium but then the underarm portion was too wide. i might have gotten a medium petite but small petite would have been too small i think. i hope the quality holds up which was the only thing i wasn't sure of. great summer tank to throw on with jeans or shorts.,5,1,3

175,30,Cute,"This top has a flattering shape. the neckline is low, but not too low for work, and it flares a bit at the bottom. my only complaint is that it is short. i have a longish torso and this shirt hits right at the top of my pant's waistline. i just prefer tops to be a bit longer, but it's still a cute top.",4,1,0
175,30,Great top for pregnant women:),I recently bought this top in both the black and blue motifs and love it! i'm currently 7 months pregnant and this top provides great coverage for the bump. i agree with another reviewer that noted that it is a little tight in the bust as i had to go up a size for that reason.,5,1,0

175,33,"Comfy, but not flattering to larger busts","I really liked this top-- the red gingham is adorable, and it looked great tucked into the pencil skirt i was also trying on. sadly, it had two things going against it:
- when i didn't tuck it in, it looked like i was hiding an early pregnancy (it just hangs from the chest, and my bust is relatively large-- 34dd)
- the material is awfully thin, and i don't know how it would hold up (that's a concern when you're spending $90 on a ""casual"" top)
i would certainly consider purchasing this on sale",4,1,30

175,35,Flattering,"I ordered this in the navy and the red/blue plaid. fit- i'm usually a 10 m. after reading reviews, i ordered a l and it was the right choice. it's silky and covers up my postpartum middle nicely. i was worried the pleats would accentuate that part of me, but it does not at all. print- love the plaid. not sure about the navy with diff color dots. that one is probably going back.",5,1,0

175,39,Whimsical,This is a cute blouse. i get lots of compliments. i bought the natural color. super flattering. i bought my normal size in most retailer stuff and had to return for bigger. the chest area is a bit snug. had to send back for a larger size.,3,1,1

175,40,Different than pictured,"I really wanted to like this top, just got it in mail today, but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it, but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color, very soft too, unusual for rayon of this type, feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red, size",2,1,2

175,45,Super cute & comfy top!,"When i saw this top online i loved it, and in person i love it even more! so perfect for spring/summer and i can see it even transitioning into fall. the sizing is perfect - i am a size 12/l in tops, and the size 12 i ordered is just right. it's loose but not too loose or frumpy looking. the fabric is slightly thin but that's perfect for the summer, but it would be cute layered with a cami or a cardigan when it's cooler. the only thing is, if you a little busty, the neckline might dip a tiny bit",5,1,6

175,46,"Orange color was pretty, poor quality fabric",I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.,1,0,0
175,46,"Xl fits great, color description is a bit off","I ordered the purple in size xl. the fit on me matches the model so i think it's true to size. i wouldn't say there's much purple to this print. i can't really find any. the areas where the blue/red overlap just look navy. the photos show how it really looks. it's a great mix of light brown, peach, white, red and different shades of blue. there will be variations because of pattern placement. i love this style--it's very comfortable.",5,1,2

186,26,"Really thick, quality top. very swingy bottom","I bought the red and white. both tank tops were a nice, thick material- definitely high quality. i was hoping there would just be a little bit of swing at the bottom, just enough to be loose and flattering. but there is a ton of extra fabric at the end, which with a larger bust wound up edging into looking a little maternity. but i think it'd be great on you if you tend to do well with very drapey or swingy tops. it runs a touch big- im normally between a small and an xs, and the xs was not even",3,0,0

i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown. it has a slight drape, but it's not really baggy at all. i bought the grey and it looks lighter on-line that it really is. it's a bit darker and has a silver essence also. i liked this so much, i just bought another one in mauve.",5,1,20

187,41,Instant comfort,I love these jeans-the minute you put them on they feel broken in and comfortable. they do have a long inseam and need to be worn with a stacked heel but that adds to the aesthetic. i ordered my normal size-i usually wear a 27 and could have kept them-but wanted a snugger fit through the bum. so i gave them to a friend and ordered one size down and got the perfect fit for me.,5,1,0
187,42,Great pair of jeans!!,"I was hesitant to buy these jeans online because citizens are generally not very forgiving, being that they don't have much stretch.  they are always in the stack that i try on but haven't bought a pair of citizens in several years. these are totally different!  the have enough stretch to be sculpting without being uncomfortable while keeping the substantial feeling that comes with denim versus leggings.  i looooooove these jeans!!!",5,1,0

189,33,No way,This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.,1,0,0

195,36,Love these pants!,These are a great versatile pair of black pants. they look chic without trying too hard and they work well dressed up or down. they do run a bit big as others have said. i generally wear a 16 and thats what i got in these but they're definitely big and bag out by the end of the day.,5,1,1
195,37,Lovely with one complaint,"This looks great on. i'm busty, so it's a little awkward to zip under the armhole, but not bad. a little bit tight in the bust, but the smocked back stretches to accommodate. 
i just wish the description had mentioned that it has silicone gripper across the front neckline. i have a sensitivity to this type of coating/elastic and generally avoid it, since it causes my skin to turn red and break out in blisters. the jumpsuit looks so great on that i will keep it and either remove the gripper or s",4,1,3

199,43,Flattering!,"Beautiful dress! love the colors and fit. can be dressed up or down. the only negative is that the buttons fall off. this is my third dress and it too lost a button the first time i wore it. i don't live near an retailer store so i will be keeping it anyways, as this is already my third dress :( my advice would be to reinforce the three buttons as soon as you buy it. there is one at the top, front of the dress and one on each sleeve.",4,1,10

200,29,Wardrobe staple for me!,"Super soft and stylish. it's a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets. love it. i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small. i'm 5'10 and 142lbs. typically wear a size s, but sometimes have to size up to a m. i got a s. fits great. not too tight. sleeves are plenty long enough. i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work (aka grad school), and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings, but its not too bulky so i can keep it on",5,1,3

200,61,Cute jacket,I just received this jacket in the cream color. it is so cute! you can change it from 3/4 to full length sleeves. i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better. in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched. the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper. i love this jacket! it is a good cross over from athletic to cas,5,1,0
201,20,Love this sweater!,"I initially saw this sweater in the store and it really stood out. the rose pink color is absolutely beautiful and i love the glimmer band. it adds a beautiful detail to the sweater. the fabric is very soft. the only downside i see, is that lint did get all over the tank top i was wearing underneath. though i think that will change over time as i wear it more. it wasn't a huge inconvenience, which is why i still give this 5 stars. i am always a small at retailer, which is what i ordered, so",5,1,1
201,20,Will get lots of use,"I was attracted to this sweater because of the pretty fur collar and the color, which is a gray-black that seems to go with everything. the cut is a-line so it drapes over what you are wearing underneath. since the fabric is soft it doesn't add a lot of bulk and keeps the fit flattering even though it is not fitted. i have worn it many times since purchasing because the color and fit make it easy to throw on over your outfit for some additional warmth. personally i found that it runs very large.",4,1,3

201,25,Just okay,"I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty, but the fabric isn't nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said, the fit is pretty flattering. i didn't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i've been looking for this style of sweater, so i'll probably keep it. however, it really didn't meet my expectations for quality.",3,0,1

201,63,Comfort and color,This is a cross between a sweater and a sweatshirt. not a heavy weight but very warm. the color is vibrant. many compliments.,5,1,0
201,65,A cozy wardrobe staple,"This top is large like with free people i got an extra small and washed it right away and put it in the dryer and it is soft and perfect. so comfortable and will be a go to top with jeans, pj bottoms or leggings/ i love the pocket and my cell phone fits perfectly. i am now ordering the other color. for reference i am 5.5"" and 125 pounds.",5,1,6
201,65,Super cute,"Sometimes ""swing"" styles don't work on me - i'm on the busty side so they often make me look like i'm wearing a tent from a side view. not so this sweater. it's more of an a-line shape than a ""swing"" style and is very flattering - i would think on all body types. i love that it zips up and has pockets. the plaid is really pretty and the overstitching detail and ribbbed bottom elevate the styling. super soft too - not an itch in sight!!

201,74,Fun sweater with lots of color,"I really wanted to love this sweater after reading all the reviews, but it just didn't work for me. the pattern is amazing (almost a little over powering, making it one of a kind and unique) but what i didn't like the color of the knit collar and front bands----it's an old looking mauve-tweed grandpa color. i probably would have kept it if that color was different. it was returned to find a different coat style sweater.",3,1,0
202,23,,Cute sweater. snap was broken when i received it. and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock. ugh!,1,0,2
202,26,Comfy & gorgeous,"I've only worn the sweater a handful of times, but i'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is. it's a bit on the baggier side, but that doesn't stop it from looking great. i've gotten complements on it every time i've worn it. i would highly recommend it to people who don't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles.",5,1,0
202,26,Very nice vest but itchy,"This vest is very nice and fashionable, very stylish. i like it a lot. however, it is too itchy. the opening in the front didn't allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold. however, the itchiness is too much. i don't wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere, so i could not imaging wearing this vest, it is too itchy. why ruin such a good thing?",3,1,0

202,35,Too itchy for me,"I was searching for an ivory cardigan and i ordered this in my usual size small and an extra small. after trying them both on, the xs looked better, i like a more fitted look. a tad tight i the arms when layered but otherwise would have been a good fit, but the acrylic in this garment was too itchy for me around the neck. i thought this might be the case but took a chance anyway. also the pockets add a bit of bulk in the hip area, definitely not something i want.",4,1,4
202,38,Wanted to love this...,"I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this, but this one didn't make the cut for me.",1,0,0

202,41,There's wool in this! whimper!,"This cardigan is utterly gorgeous. way prettier on than i feared. my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms, and so i finally looked closely at the tag. the tag says the *back* section (which looks exactly like the weave on the arms) has a measly 5% wool snuck into the fabric content. why, retailer? why wool? i am so sensitive to it! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day, classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it.

now i have a problem",5,1,1
202,41,Very pretty sweater,,5,1,0
202,41,,I really like the warmth and loose cut of this sweater. it is great for layering and looks nice dressed up or down. my only gripe is i would love for it to have a second fastening. if it had another snap a little further down the body you keep keep it more securely closed. other than that it was a really great purchase.,4,1,8
202,43,Could work for another body type,This was too big in the arms & i didn't like how there was only one button toward the top so that it made your body look hippy. little too itchy too. best thing about it was the look of the slouchy collar.,3,1,3
202,46,"Love, love!!!","I just need to write a review on this sweater because it's the best!!! i currently own the cream/blue stripe sweater and have recieved many compliments. what i was most happy about it was the fact that i have washed it several times and the sweater looks like new and has held it's shape. i have ordered the gold one as well and it's still on backorder, waiting for it to arrive :) don't procrastinate, it's worth the price.",5,1,2
202,48,Oh so soft!,"This cozy sweater has the feel of cashmere. it fits loose and has a similar look as a wrap or poncho. looks better over sleeveless or short sleeve tops. i'm surprised it isn't one size fits all b/c it is very generous in the xs/s, which i got and i'm a 6. i can see wearing this all year long, even summer cool nights. very classic style. the picture on website looks frumpy to me, but on it is very flattering.",5,1,4

i fear wool as i have sensitive skin but this is soft and snuggly. the structure will allow for fit over many different types of under-layers, but unlike so much offered lately, it is not huge or tent-like, but a perfect fit. it is a heavier weight - light coat weight? this is perfect for me in the south. the color is as pictured, golden. in my xxs petite, the sleeves are p",5,1,3

203,30,Wonderful coat,"I love this coat. it's everything i've been looking for in a trench: navy blue, cut for dresses, with a vintage flair. and the medium fits like a glove (i'm a size 8). all that being said, be forewarned that this coat in unlined, so it won't be that warm a layer. the seams are covered in a bright turquoise bias tape so it doesn't seem especially unfinished. still worth the price on sale.",4,1,1

203,35,Discrepency between regular and petite,"So a bit of a bone to pick with retailer. i am normally a petite xs (32b chest). however the petite sizing was not available online so i ordered a regular xs thinking i could always have it altered. i could barely button across the chest. huh?! when i went to return it at the store, i noticed they had xs petite on the rack so decided to try it. it fits perfect - like how it should! i can button fine across the chest and there is a little extra room.

i have no idea why the sizing is so off between",4,1,3

203,40,Multi-functional piece,"Saw this on the retailer emails as a cover and knew i had to try it on. went into the store following day and tried it. to my delight the tencel fabric is light enough for southern california weather and can be worn as a trench coat over skinny jeans, leggings or dresses or act as a dress in itself! love the navy color as it is has more of a washed looked and not too bold. what attracted me to this piece in the first place was the ruffled bottom and the rounded flaps on the back that is different",5,1,8

203,48,Fabulous feminine trench!,"The skirt on this trench has tons of fabric. it goes on and on, and drapes and twirls beautifully. as a trench, it fits well and does the trick. i believe the skirt is heavy enough not to blow around too much, but i haven't been out in extremely strong winds yet. it fits true to size, at the knee (i'm 5'5""). i sized up because i assumed i would be layering it over clothes. my regular size fit fine over a lightweight cardigan.",5,1,0
203,49,Cute! but not a coat,"Once i saw this trench coat i thought it was so cute! i'm usually a small in retailer tops but can be a little broad so i decided to go with the medium (based on other reviews). when i received the coat, it was a little tight in the shoulders but still doable. i was surprised how thin it was (just a single sheet of cloth) and how full the skirt bottom was (however, there is a cute light blue seem lining inside). overall this trench coat is not really a warm coat, but more of a fun piece to dress u",4,1,3
203,49,Too much fabric for a petite,"I just loved this when i saw it in store. beautiful fabric, lovely color. i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out. i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller, but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom, unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs, it might end up looking like a witches coat. at least that is what i was told by my daughter.",3,0,1

204,39,"Great product, not so great fabric","I love this brand, i literally live in their tops.. this one is a bit of a disappointment. it is made out of fabric that feels cheap, reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products. it's very thin, and see through. unless wearing a camisole/slip underneath, you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath- no muffin tops or back fat!!i got the black, and am keeping it only because i love the design, need a black top desperat",2,0,10

color was nice , fit was good too, i just felt not ""special"" enough... but if you are looking for a tshirt, then i say give it a try, as it was comfortable and the shape at least is unusual.

207,36,Gets baggy with wear,"These are very well-made jeans, the fabric is substantial and gives a lot of stretch with movement. i adore the extra inch or so in the rise of the waist, and they make my butt look great. however, these jeans fit like a glove when i put them on first thing, but within an hour or so of wear they are so baggy it's like wearing a size bigger. i'd say perhaps buy a size smaller if you want them to fit snugly through the day. if you like roomy, then buy your regular size.",3,1,4
207,36,My new every day jeans,I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable. the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy. i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too. they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer. these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear.,5,1,1

207,56,,Love the fit of pilcro jeans. it's always a struggle to find a white jean that is flattering around the thighs and doesn't show off lumps and bumps! these are terrific quality indeed.,5,1,2

207,57,Nice high waisted flare,"I'm so glad to own this one. i just tried it today and fully satisfied as always with pilcro. true to size, perfect color.
high waisted and flare just right. can be paired with cropped top or peasant top. looking taller on this outfit!
best of all i got it on sale!",5,1,0
207,59,"Cute, but not for my figure","I just got these and had to return them as they were not becoming on my physique. for reference, i'm
5' 5""; 122 lbs; 26"" waist; 38""hips and i have a long torso and short legs. i ordered a 29 petite. the fit
was tight, but they are supposed to fit tight. if i wasn't so ""hippy"" i would have kept them. the model is
slender with long legs and she looks fantastic in them. not me. i do recommend these as they are cute, but perhaps geared for a more slender body type.",4,1,6
207,60,Very good quality jeans,"These jeans are fantastic - the denim is very high quality and the fit is true to size. the dark rinse is very flattering and pairs well with almost anything. my only (small) gripe is that the length is a bit awkward. i'm 5'4"" and it fits more like a regular pair of jeans, not ankle-length. just something to keep in mind if you're not super tall like the model in the picture.",5,1,1
207,60,,"I disagree with the most recent review! they are legging style fit but not leggings at all! they are a jean style with a patterning on them a texture.

207,64,Perfection!,"Great fit. love the mid rise! my usual size 28 in these leggings hug in all the right places. they look on me as in the model pic except the length falls abt 1"" below my ankles. i may have them hemmed after they're washed. just wait & see... 5'3"" 117#",5,1,4
207,65,Comfortable and stylish with great fit!,Finding boyfriend jeans that actually look flattering can be tricky. these fit the bill! not too baggy with a lovely side view silhouette and a front silhouette that does not make you look larger than you actually are - i instantly knew that i had to have these. look supercute with the legs rolled up or as shown in the picture. the denim is soft and the creasing and finish do not look too contrived. i sized down a size and the fit is perfect. highly recommend!,5,1,8
207,66,Favorite purchase this year,"Love these.  i bought the grey which is a grey/taupe/light olive chameleon.  totally depends upon what i wear with them.  the rolled up cuff is adorable and the material is perfect.  the fit is true to size - tight but not restrictive.  comfy all day long.   and best of all, they don't stretch out over the day.   i'm 5'10, a size 6 normally and a size 28 fit me perfectly.",5,1,0
207,66,Love!!,"These are my new favorite pair of jeans. very flattering (particularly on the bum)! the wash is great - dark and slightly distressed, with a frayed hem at the ankle. the leg is straight rather than super skinny, which i am really enjoying as of late. fyi - i am usually a size 29 in denim, but went down to a 28 in this style.",5,1,2
207,66,"Nice, but.....","I love almost everything about these jeans.  color, fabric and rise are perfect.  unfortunately, they bag at the knee on me.  should have ordered a size smaller than my usual, but since i have worn them, i will keep them.",4,1,0
207,70,Great pants,"These pants are flattering yet comfortable. i am thrilled that they are available in tall sizes because i am 6 feet tall. the 36 inch inseam is perfect and for me prevents the problem of ""high water"" pants. the zippered pockets are flattering yet useful. the high rise waist is wonderful. these pants are perfect for wear in a number of occasions. they are great.",5,1,9
208,28,Runs small,"This top is beautiful in the model shot, but average in person. it ran really small, i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest, and was pretty short (i am 5'7""). also, the material is very thin, not so much that you can see your undergarment, but if you get cold everyone will know it. also, for the price, i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale, if you are interested in this top.",3,0,11
208,31,Hole in it after a month,"I have had this shirt for a little over a month. i've wore it maybe 3-5 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder. it's not even on a seam, so i can't fix it. i expect much better quality from retailer. don't buy this. the quality is very disappointing. which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts.",2,0,0
208,38,Amazingly soft and comfy but...,"This is so so soft and has a nice stretch to it. the fit is great, love the side zippers. i wore it today for the first time and before i even arrived at the office i noticed a crazy amount of pilling where my purse rubbed. nothing i cant get rid of (till next time i carry a bag!) but if this keeps up there soon won't be much of a shirt left. very disappointing for the price. was lucky enough to snag this on sale but it was still pricey for the quality.",3,1,2
208,38,Disappointing,"I was expecting a tunic with a bit of structure and weight to layer over leggings, with boots, etc.

this is just an oversized turtleneck - there's nothing special about it. it's thin material. nothing to justify the price.

the sizing seems odd. i'm normally a 2 on the top and 4 on the bottom. the xs was huge up top (i was swimming in it - much larger than it appears in pictures on the model) and spanned across my hips (more than the model).

209,21,Gorgeous classic,"I ordered this dress in a size 12. i'm 5'9'' and 180lb. i usually wear size 14 but the 12 fit beautifully. the material has a nice stretch to it so that i think it would still fit whether i gained or loss 10 lbs. when i pulled it out of the box i immediately thought it read ""grandma"", but was pleasantly surprised when i put it on. it is snug in the waist and flares out nicely from there. it hits me on the knee exactly as it does the model in the picture. i plan on wearing this maybe for christma",5,1,1
209,24,Work-appropriate lace,"I've been looking for the perfect work-appropriate lace dress (for a casual/creative work environment) for a while, and this was just the ticket! the pointed collar and demure shape add some structure to the feminine lace. i rolled the sleeves to a short-sleeve length just to tone done the cutesy factor a tiny bit more (although the sleeves, worn long, are absolutely gorgeous!). the lace isn't exactly the highest quality lace that retailer has ever used, but pretty nonetheless. i'm 5'5 /125 and th",4,1,1
209,25,"Beautiful dress, cheap components","This dress is stunning, no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif, thick material, nicely cut, with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly. however, the fact that this dress has zero stretch (which is fine, if that's what you're looking for), coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured, make this dress exhausting to put on. i'm normally a 14/16 at retailer, and i ordered the 16 just to be safe, and the waist is exactly the size of my waist",3,1,22
209,26,Not for me,"I was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party. i'm 5'4"", 36c, 145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me. i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress (which is a sweater-like material) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering; the petite may have fixed it, but then the skirt would've been too short. the pleats were cute but flared out too",3,1,2
209,26,Save your money,"This dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer's aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk/jacquard fabric to give it texture, which is how it looks from the photo. obviously it would have been more expensive, but in any case, this was just a really expensive polyester dress, which it says in the product description, but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt, thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product, it'll be retailer. but now i",2,0,14

209,29,Not exactly as pictured,"I received this dress in the mail yesterday. right away, i noticed the coloring wasn't quite the same as it appears in the images online. in person, the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny, as opposed to more muted. i was willing to look past that, but then i tried it on. i ordered a small, which is my typical size in retailer dresses. it ran quite large and was way to long for me (i am 5' 4''). overall, between the coloring and sizing, this dress wasn't a hit for me.",2,0,2
209,30,In love!,This dress is perfect and so sweet! i do agree with other reviewers in that it runs about 1/2 to one size large. i run anywhere from 6-8 in retailer dresses and i ordered the 6. if you are usually in between sizes definitely order the smaller size. the smaller size also allows me to go braless even though i have a larger (34dd) chest because of the well-constructed bodice. length is nice for us tall girls as well!!,5,1,1
209,31,A bit big,"This is a lovely dress, the shape is really flattering and it's light and easy to wear. the only problem i have is it runs a little big - i'm normally a 6-8 and i'm sizing down to a 4. otherwise it's pretty perfect, the length is good for taller women (i'm 5'11"") and the bodice is sturdy enough that smaller cup sizes won't need a bra. definitely recommend this!",4,1,12
209,31,"Beautiful dress, but size up!","I am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses, and i ended up with a 4 in this one. i could barley zip up the 0, and while i could have gotten away with the 2, there is no elasticity in the waistband. the 4 is very slightly roomy, but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me. for reference, i'm 109-111 lbs, 5'4, and a 30b.

209,33,Absolutely awful,"I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck, nice length, and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust, it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the",1,0,2

209,34,Gorgeous and flattering dress by maeve,"This dress looks beautiful on. it's very flattering and comfortable to wear. it runs true to maeve's dress sizing which for me means in these dresses i always get one size larger than what i normally wear. on my 5'3"" height the regular was just above the knee. great for giving you the illusion of the figure you want even if you don't have it naturally !",5,1,15

209,44,Only for the tall at heart,"I saw this dress in our store and immediately walked over to check it out. it is quite a stunning piece. i purchased it without trying it on and wished i would have. unfortunately, there is entirely too much material in the bodice. it was overwhelming on me. for reference i am 5 ""3 and i do wear an xs but i am muscular and not thin. i think it would work well on somebody taller or leggier who could balance out the amount of material in the dress.",3,0,1

209,49,Cute dress but poor design,I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly. the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations couldn't fix it. maybe it's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw.,2,0,4

the fit of this top is not true to size, for it runs large, but is flattering on the body nonetheless. the stripes and miniature circular openings, i noticed, add beautiful detail for formal or informal events.

as a whole, this shirt is perfect! the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material",5,1,1
211,44,Soft lace and beautiful color,I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. the shirt in our store was featured in all colors.  i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft!  i felt like i was wearing a t-shirt with an easy on and easy off feel. the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in.  i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit. love!!!,5,1,0

the first time i wore this top, i paired it with denim shorts, and the hemline completely covered the shorts, so it was way more of a mini-dress than a long shirt--which is ok. if i wear it again as a top rather than a swim cover, i'd just go with yoga shorts benea",4,1,1

216,36,Gorgeous top despite some flaws,"I saw this top online, but i didn't fall in love with it until i tried it on in the store. the retailer salesperson told me that she owned this top and that she always received many compliments when wearing it, but she also warned me that the rhinestones on the sleeves were a problem as they kept getting snagged in the fabric on the body. i decided to purchase the top in the end because it is so beautiful and one of a kind, but i ended up removing all of the rhinestones on the sleeves and i haven'",5,1,1

216,36,,"I love the design of this blouse. lots of pretty details. the slits on the side are high, but with a tank underneath, it's perfect. love the length of the sleeves and the modest, flattering neckline. the only problems so far are that the rhinestones are prone to falling out and snagging other parts of the top, so you have to be careful with movements and you can't wear a sweater with it because the rhinestones would snag it a lot. even if it loses the rhinestones, it's still a beautiful blouse,",4,1,2

223,28,Adorable dress but different than pictured,Agree with other reviewers that the dress doesn't look like the picture so retailerpligie should really change it out. however i'm keeping the dress since it does look cute on. definitely more yellow in it than you can see.,4,1,0

223,35,"Cute, go to dress","I was nervous about this dress due to the reviews saying it was odd and the colors being different. but these weren't issues for me. the color is navy. it has the loops at the sides of the dress to hold the belt on, but it also has a loop in the front center of the dress, which i think is nice, no one likes a limp bow ;) the belt is nothing to write home about, but it ties the dress together nicely.

226,31,Perfect winter dress,"This is the perfect sweater dress for any occasion. i dressed it up with a belt and necklace for a christmas party and wore it with boots to just kick around the house. it's a really warm dress too, so great for colder weather. probably would not want to wear this dress in warm temps.

it's so comfortable and it's made with high quality material. i'm curvy on the bottom and my only wish is that this dress had less material around my waist- it's a pretty straight cut.",5,1,2
226,31,"Pretty, but not as pretty as i thought","I thought the colors would be brighter and i didn't realize the lace would be see through. i returned it because it was also shorter that i expected. but overall it was a nice dress, just not for me.",4,0,0
226,31,"The perfect ""blue"" period dress","I am in love with this dress. the colors are amazing but also is the fabric. it is soft and supple. i am a curvy girl and this dress does all justice to my bust, waist, and hips. this is truly an amazing dress. you can dress it up or dress it down and the best part it is professional enough for a causal office look.",5,1,3
226,31,,"I really loved the pattern and style of this dress! unfortunately, i had to return it because i have broad shoulders and it is a pretty stiff top that cut into the flabby area near my armpits. for most people it's probably perfect! but if you have wide shoulders or any concerns about the armpit flab, this might not be a great choice for you.",4,0,0
226,31,,"If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also, i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons, as several were off some of the dresses.",3,0,0

226,32,Good enough,"I purchased this dress as an easy option to throw on after the gym or on a weekend trip without fuss. the fabric is soft, hangs well, and it is well-lined. but it's also a little more bilious than perhaps necessary to be beautiful and flowing. as in, i'm very comfortable in this dress, but it's not a dress i receive compliments while wearing. perhaps it reads as maternity wear without the belt.",4,1,0

226,43,Tricky to wear,I am torn about this dress. the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it. the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent. it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra. i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist. i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well. i usually don't return online purchases unless they,3,1,2

226,47,Disappointed in the fit,"This dress is so pretty and the fabric is tightly woven so that it won't stretch as much as other sweater dresses. i am disappointed in the sleeves though. the cut is way below the armpit so that when you raise your arms, it pulls tight and is uncomfortable. for the price, and the amount of time i wanted to wear it, it's not worth keeping. another thing is that the fabric is tightly woven so if you are cold natured and ok with the sleeve issue, this is the dress for you. however, if you are hot",4,0,4

226,51,Amazing detail!,"Love this dress. from the great fabric (soft yet substantial) that's similar to sweater material, to the amazing detail of the flower design (it's really so unique and i mean that in a good way!), to the color (a tan with gold flecking), and lastly to the really flattering fit, not to mention those retro bell sleeves!  all around a fun dress! it was true to size and not too short, hitting my 5'4"" height about 2"" above my knees.",5,1,0
226,51,Beautiful pattern,I love this dress. i read the reviews on it before i purchased and they were spot on. i have broad shoulders so i ordered the large. it was still plenty roomy but i wore a royal blue sweater with it and it pulled the waist in just enough to make it fit without a belt. i would buy it again!!,5,1,0
226,51,Disappointed,I was so excited to get this dress. i saw someone try it on in the store and waited all season for it to go on sale. i loved it except for the seam that was right at the neckline in the front. they didn't even try to match up the fabrics. it was so obvious and cheap looking that i had to send this dress back. so sad!,3,0,1
226,51,Love this dress!,"Love this dress!!! i agree with the other reviewers, i had to size up one size, but then it was perfect. i'm 5'5, 125 lbs. and the size 6 worked great.",5,1,0
226,51,Loved the style but the fit was off,"Loved this dress until i tried it on! it was too big in the body and tight on top in the arm area. from the reviews already posted stating the guy was great, i'm wondering if i just received a defective dress? i also wish the dress were a truer orange/mango color instead of a burnt orange since this dress is for spring/summer.",3,0,6
226,51,Perfect fit,"This will be a great go to piece with leggings and boots for winter and to transition into spring with wedges. i purchased the blue stripe and the multi stripe with the intention of returning one but i liked them enough to keep both. the quality of material is great and super soft and i love the little snap detail on the sleeves. i am 5' 7"", and most always wear a size medium and it fit perfect. the dress hit right above the knee but not too high so i can wear the dresses with or without tights.",5,1,0
226,51,Pretty for a narrow bohemian,"Not good for for an hourglass shape. lots and lots of pretty fabric, but the waist hits just where the hips widen--very bohemian (just no good for a figure 8). the sizing is generous. with both elastic and a zipper, there's room to go small if between sizes, be aware: the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic. i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out. would perhaps work on a very narrow person who's completel",3,0,3

226,51,"Very pretty, but truly gigantic!","This is a very pretty, particularly youthful dress.  but, do be forewarned, it is gigantic.  size down even if you never do, and get a petite if you are even a little short.  i didn't size down enough and it was both wide and long -- it looked ridiculous.  i am petite, and the hem went way below my knees (and the dress was considerably longer than the slip).",4,1,0
226,51,,"The snake and the studs, they make the dress. sadly, the snake is hard to find, as mentioned in another review. this dress also runs large, i'm usually a 12 and went down to 10. the images are misleading too. two pics show a small, fitted look, and the other two show a full, swing look. i'm trying to make this work but it may have to go.",3,1,4

226,52,Adorable dress but poor quality :(,"I just think this dress is so cute! i love it with booties! 
here are the fit details: i'm 5'4 1/2"" and the front of the dress hits just above my knees. (i was concerned that it would be too short for my lifestyle based on the photo). the sleeves roll up and have a tab to button, however the button is very low. therefore, the sleeve rolls up not mid arm, but actually about three inches above my wrist!

226,52,Fantastic dress,"This is a great dress, both in design and comfort. the material is very soft and warm. yet it is also very stylish, and can be dressed up with big necklaces, a belt, and boots. the stylist in the store mentioned wearing it with a vest. it is a great piece that has so many possibilities. i bought it in navy. thank you retailer!!",5,1,0

226,52,Not a fan - childish,"I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size, but is very short. i am 5'2"" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee.",3,0,2
226,52,"Pretty colors, but fits like a sack","It made me look extra thick in the middle--could pass for maternity wear. pretty colors. fabric is fine. it's just too shapeless and not flattering on me. i'm 5'11"" and it was also on the short side for me. even if it fit better, probably too short for my age (40s).",3,0,1
226,53,A new favorite!,"I absolutely love this dress. the color is beautiful, the fit is flattering and it is so comfy i didn't want to take it off until bedtime. it is an all around winner. if i could do one thing to make it absolutely perfect i would take and inch or two off the hem. i am think of doing that but seriously i am not sure i want to have it out in alterations when i could be wearing it, it is just too comfy and cute!",5,1,0

226,53,Linen coolness,I love the way the dress fit definitely a flip flop by the poolside bar dress. i ordered the mango colored one and was disappointed that the color resembled a dark squash orange and not as bright as it looked in picture. i think it will look nice with a tan so i will keep it. wouldn't plan to dress it up too much because it will definitely wrinkle ! i am a petite 5'4 and got the regular and it fits just above my knees which is good for my taste!,4,1,0
226,53,My new favorite,This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more. it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days. it fits tts. well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay ( as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with). the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail.  sure to sell out.,5,1,0

226,54,Cute dress but......,I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i don't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.,3,0,0
226,54,Great fall dress,I tried this on in the store and loved it. it is very comfortable. i sized up one or two sizes. i am very thin and somewhat petite but wanted a little more length. it will be a great dress for fall as the fabric is heavy enough to wear into fall. i think it looks better in person than online. would recommend it if you like this kind of dress. love that it has pockets too. great quality.,4,1,0

226,55,Great dress!,This dress is a great casual outfit. tha fabric is substantial and very soft. the only negative would be it is a little large through the chest/arms. i ordered a large as i am curvy but would like to exchange for a medium. sadly the medium is sold out but i love the dress so much i am keeping it!,4,1,0

226,56,Gorgeous fabric,"This is an absolutely gorgeous dress. i have the arcata patchwork dress which fits beautifully without looking too full, but this one is just too voluminous. also, the bottom of the front yoke hits at a weird spot on my bust. this would be a great maternity dress or it would be perfect for a thin woman who can carry off the large amount of fabric. so disappointed, the fabric is beautiful and the colors are too. this can be worn year round, with sandals or boots.",5,1,16
226,56,I'm over 50 and over 150 lbs and love this dress!,"The large is perfect for me and is just my style - not too baggy but just shapely enough to where to the office with or without leggings, as the fall approaches. i bought the blue; the color is rich and saturated. the material is soft and all around comfortable, which is my number one factor in buying clothes. love its versatility too, since a jacket and scarf can dress it up. shoes also dress up or dress down the dress. all in all a bargain.",4,1,4

231,62,Beautiful!,"I grabbed this immediately when i saw it in the store - the details are beautiful - beading, embroidery, and small opening details on the arms. from a practicality standpoint, it has pockets, it's machine washable, and it can easily be worn as is, with black leggings or tall boots in fall, and then throw an additional chunky ivory cardigan on for winter. for sizing, i am usually a size s and found it to fit loosely, but in comfortable slightlyyyy swingy way. if i had sized down the shoulder seam",5,1,54

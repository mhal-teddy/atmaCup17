0,32,So happy i bought this skirt!,"I love this skirt. it does run a little small, i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist, but still works. i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned. i've been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it. i also work with kids, and they all love it as well.",0
0,34,Runs small,"Beautiful patterns and colors, but it sits very high and runs small. i'm normally a size 4 and got the small. zipped all the way, but on the snug side. the skirt sits so high that the fabric coming down was a bit awkward. such a shame because it really is beautiful and looks great on the model probably because she's wearing a belt to hide how high it rides and flares out.",0
0,37,Love the comfort of thi skirt,It is easily paired with a nice tip for work and feels great to wear all day,0

0,39,,I usually wear a size 8/10 and i needed a large in this skirt. it flows so beautifully!,0
0,40,Pretty print!,"This print/color combination is really pretty. i think it's a little muted compared to the picture, but still very pretty. it is definitely longer than expected - i'm 5'-5"" and it almost touches the floor. will definitely need to wear with heels. colors will actually work in the fall with boots and in spring with heeled sandals. it actually has a shorter underskirt, so there's no accidental show. i really like the dark blue wrap #extra fabric at top# - sits below the waist and will help hide imp",4

0,44,Circa 1970 peasant style skirt,"I just revieved this skirt and like it a lot. they did not have my size in petite so i ordered the regular length . it is very long. i am 5'4 1/2 and tried it with 4 inch heels and still had about 2 inches dragging on the floor and will need to be hemmed. in this picture, the stitching around the flowers appear white but it is actuallly a shiny, delicate gold thread in person. hopefulluy it will not fray with wear. i initially got a white top to go with it and it works, but i think a red or navy",7
0,48,Very nice!,"Love this skirt, beautiful fabric and lined. looks great with a tailored jean jacket by pilcro or the window pain patterned retailer cartonnier jacket. i chose the size 8 though a little snug in the waist it fit better than the size 10. i am 150 lbs and 5'4 inches and curvy with small waist but curvy hips with a tush so this cut is perfect for my shape. i love the asymmetrical design with how the skirt will partial zip and the fabric attachment underneath with hidden button. love the edgy look. so",1

0,66,Sizing issue,"Such a beautiful print. i sized up to a 14 because it looked like it has a high waist and it does. the waist comes almost to my bra line. unfortunately, there's a huge amount of fabric and it swallowed me. not slimming at all. i felt like i was wearing a curtain.  i loved the slits in the photo but due to the amount of fabric they weren't visible. i'm short and this literally pooled on the ground a few inches. if you're tall and thin, this is a beauty.",0
1,20,Great jumper!,Picked this up at the store in my usual size small. it fit perfectly. i am a 34d and the buttons closed with no gap. the length was just above the ankle and the fit is slim. so comfy. my guess is this is going to sell out because everyone including the sa's wanted to buy one. loved the color too~very versatile.,2
1,27,Summer staple,"I am so happy with this jumpsuit! it is the perfect comfortable and casual summer outfit. the fabric is super soft. i was unsure about the length at first because it's shorter than my other jumpsuits, but if you scrunch up the bottom of the legs and add some sandals, it's a great look. 
highly recommend!",0
1,28,Pills very quickly,"I wore this immediately after receiving it as a gift. after wearing it for almost 2 hours the fabric started to pill between my legs where it rubs. sucks!! i actually really love this jumper and it's very soft and comfortable. just wish it would last longer :( i'm going to be wearing this all the time this summer but i'm pretty sure it will rub to the point where there will be holes in my pants... between my legs.. 

only complaint about sizing is that the top is too big. i'm 5'2"", 135lbs, 34a",0
1,34,,Love! love! love! i got this jumper right before it started getting hot and it has been my go to all summer! fun night out with the girls.. perfect! walking around the mall... awesome! at work with a green vest... super! every time i wear this i get tons of compliments! did i mention it feels like you're wearing pajamas which in my book is everything! get it!,0
1,48,I wish,"I wanted this romper so bad, after buying (and loving) a shirt from madewell made with the same fabric earlier this year. i wish this romper was just a little bit longer and roomier. i normally wear a size 10 or 12 and bought the large. it fit me ok but i felt like i wanted it to be just a little bit more oversized around my hips and definitely wanted it to be longer in the legs. (retailer please stop with the capri lengths! it's tired!!) if you are narrow-hipped you will fare much better. the fab",0
1,51,Cute,"This is a cute, casual romper but i'm on the fence about keeping it. i hate when there is a pattern mismatch - especially across the butt and that's why i'm on the fence. i bought my usual xs/0, (5'7"", 115lbs, 32b). i would say that it is a little roomy around the bust - if i keep it i might have to have it altered slightly to stop my bra from showing. this is the first jumpsuit that i have tried that actually accommodates my longer torso - so many seem to ride up and that is not flattering!

1,53,Not proportioned,I ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug. you need a big chest and small legs and bottom. too bad. it's very cute.,3
1,57,"Amazing, versatile piece for spring and summer","I picked this up unexpectedly and whisked it into the dressing room a long with a handful of other things today.
i noticed right away how soft it was! so comfy! i have never owned a romper before so i wasn't expecting to like it--- i was so wrong, i'm sorry romper! i love you!

2,38,Boho brilliance for below freezing temperatures,"If you're like me and wish you could carry on downtown boho dressing when the time to take out your puffer comes to pass, this tunic is essential. though the silky alpaca-wool knit is thicker than gauzy cotton, it drapes just as well and keeps one's self warm and cozy without the bulk of a sweater. i was concerned with the elastic banding at the bottom of the tunic because i'm only 5'4"", but high-waisted, and banded hems tends to always hit me at the wrong spot. luckily, it's not very binding, s",4

2,46,Too large even in xs!,"I'm 5'5"" and 140 lbs - hardly super-tiny and the xs was swimming on me. the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater/jacket just hangs off the body. believe it when they say ""oversized styling"" - unfortunately will have to return.",4
2,47,Cool sweater,"This sweater is really pretty in person, and well-made. every time i wear it someone stops what they are doing to compliment it; one person asked if it was home-made( in a good way) i will admit that i would not have paid full price and did get it on sale, and in that case it's worth it. the sweater does have an unusual cut. the waist is boxy and the back is a bit shorter, but somehow it works. for me i see it as a cool style and not a mistake. it's super warm and i love it.",1
2,51,So much potential...,This coat is beautiful in color and design. we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it. i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been 9 months pregnant and still would have had room to spare. i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range.,2
2,52,Huge,"I am 5'4"" 120lbs, got xs. it was huge on me. had to return it. very trendy, great quality, unfortunate design. not worth the money.",9
2,54,Cute but chunky,"While i love the design, this sweater even in the small is too over-sized for me and was unflattering. it was returned.",0
2,59,Love it!!,I love this sweater. it is a beautiful color and i love the boxy shape. very soft.,1
2,67,Gorgeous and enormous,"First, i did not notice the description mentioning metallic thread. i was disappointed when i opened the box to find it is a metallic, but actually i'm glad i didn't know because i love it. it does not look cheap and it really works. the pale peachy color is gorgeous and the metallic is subtle enough. the real issue for me is the size. i ordered the small and it is huge. enormous. especially from the back. the seam on the sleeve is just above my elbow so it's almost a bat wing kind of thing and",7
2,83,Gorgeous!,"This sweater is beautiful!
the lace is gorgeous and the sweater is soft and cozy.....rare to find a top that is stunning and comfortable at the same time!
the lace is very high quality, and enhances the sweater in a very sophisticated way.....adding that little something special.
the color keeps the overall look elegant and appropriate for any age.
runs true to size.",10
3,25,Weird boobs,"I wanted to love this dress, and thought it would be perfect for a barn wedding i have coming up. it was allllllmost right but sadly fell short. the bib that hangs over the bust hits in a really unflattering mid point that makes you look wide. nipple tassels effect. plus i would feel the urge to keep pulling it down. did notice some of the puckering others mentioned but didn't bother me, however, the way the lining and the dress line up at the bottom did. so close, so sad",1
3,26,Underestimated,"When i first saw this dress, it honestly didn't catch my eye, but as i kept seeing it in on the catalog and other places on pinterest, i realized how unique this dress is. i looked at the reviews and was surprised at how negative the comments were- i'm the type of lady who gets stuck on something and won't get off of it until i try it for myself. so, i ordered it on sale and i love it! it isn't flannel material, and so i wasn't expecting this to be a dress that would keep me warm by itself- but",2
3,27,Beautiful!!,,0
3,29,Fits snug,"This dress was too cute to pass up! i loved it online but when i got it home, it was so tight i couldn't zip up my normal size. the length was perfect on me being 5'7"". the fabric and detail was beautiful. if you have a bust, order a size up. beautiful dress just really snug up top.",0
3,31,I wanted to love this so much!!,"I wanted to love this dress so much but it just looked frumpy no matter what i did. i'm normally a 14, and i bought a size 12 and it still looks very baggy and not flattering. i'm sad because in photos it's my favorite dress of all time!",0
3,33,In love!!,"I think this dress is my favorite purchase this whole year! it fits like a dream! i saw it in the store while it was full price and tried on an 8 (the only size they had left!). i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, but the 8 was quite large, so i passed. after it went on sale, i ordered a 6 with my fingers crossed! glad i ordered when i did, as they sold out fast! fabric is a nice substantial weight, great for fall! the fit is great, not tight at all and more of an a-line on me, which is weird",1
3,33,Worth the hype,"I had been hearing about this dress for months and was so excited to see they brought it back in more colors. the reviews i read claimed it runs small in the chest area. i'm a true pear shape (23b, i normally wear - size 2, xs, on top and size 4-6 on the bottom, but with dresses i almost always get size 2) because of the swing a nature of the dress i decided to size down with this one. i was nervous how tight it would be up top but i also didn't want it to look like inwas wearing a sack! so i to",2
3,34,Beautiful!,"Love the colors!! i'm 5'2"" and the regular goes down to my ankles like a petite dress would normally. if you get petite, it would be as high as it is on the model. the material is comfortable and i can see this as a pretty versatile piece.",0
3,34,Dissapointed,"I have to confess i had very high hopes for this dress. i was buying it as a stylish, modern alternative to a business suit. i wanted this dress to work as a piece to deliver presentations in or attend faculty functions. tailored, conservative, and edgy at the same time. several hundred dollars dress should meet the aforementioned needs, i thought. but it did not. the best description for the dress is ""blah"", average.

the material is textures and crinkly, not slick. the top is cream/ivory color",4
3,35,Didn't fit right,,1
3,35,Love this dress,This dress is lovely! so flattering. i'm 5'6 and 140 pounds pre pregnancy and just into my second trimester. purchased a 4. will work for many more months and again after baby.,5
3,35,Very disappointed,"Regretfully, this dress is on its way back for an exchange. the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size, i ordered it in both colors, however, the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress, and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom. again, the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching, pulls , or tears for an exchange, but i can't pay 130"" for a dress that is already torn.",6
3,36,Very flattering!,This dress is very flattering. great unique dress.,1
3,37,Disappointed,I'm so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control.,0
3,37,So comfortable,"I love the style of this dress, comfortable but chic, and it feels great!",0
3,38,Lovely summer dress,"I love this beautiful summer dress! i am tall (5' 10""), and this dress is a great length on me. sometimes with high/low dresses, the ""high"" is too short, but this dress is perfect. it does run large. i originally ordered a medium, but had to return it for a small. it is very voluminous. my only complaint would be the arm holes are huge. i am going to have to wear a camisole or bandeau top under it, or you can see my bra.",2

3,39,Canary yellow,"First, i received mine with the back button (by the neck) busted (the part where you insert the button was loose, so could not button). 
i ordered the yellow one, and was surprised how yellow it was when received. it is brighter than the picture shows, not bad though.
the cut of the dress is nice, very ""sweet"", i liked that it was flowy and the lace was beautiful to me. arms were a tad tight, only because i have muscular arms. stil lable to wear it.

3,40,You need to be tall,"I'm 5'-4"", 130lbs with a 32f chest. this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu. i can't imagine this looking good on anyone who isn't 7' tall. also, the straight across, rather high neck line wasn't flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge. the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap. it wasn't see through but it had the feel of a nightgown, not a hundred dollar dress.",0

3,41,Not so much....,"After seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out, i was curious about it, but thought i was out of luck. it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size. i tried it and wasn't sold. however, i loved the color. it was snug across the shoulders and arms. the rest was somewhat flowy, but boxy at the same time. i ended up bringing it home to think on it. after trying it on again, i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t",1

3,43,Disappointed,"I have never taken the time to write a review but i was so disappointed by this dress. the design is cute and i got the medium instead of a small (i'm normally a 4/6) and i wanted to make sure it was a bit looser and below the knee. that was a good call because the fit is comfy and cute belted. however, it is so very thin and see through. i was looking forward to a cool, cotton dress for summer but this will definitely require a full slip if i decide to keep it. it came with no slip at all so th",10
3,46,A longing,"I was eyeing this dress for some time and was undecided about making the purchase. at a reduced price and 40%discount, i had to succumb! i was surprised by the fabric, a bit flimsy. however, the design makes up for the style. i'm anxious to wear at the first opportunity of spring/summer!!!",0

3,49,Love this dress!,"This is one of my all time favorite retailer purchases. this dress is perfect in every way - mine fits me exactly like the model and i was lucky enough to purchase it in black. if you're on the fence, take the plunge and buy this dress - you won't be disappointed!",0
3,50,Great summer  dress,I found this dress at my local retailer must be a web order return i feel in love with it once i put it on its better in person that online but it does run a little tight in the chest area  it was fine for me as i'm not big busted,2
3,50,"I love it, but it may not be for everyone.","This dress is perfect for me (i'm very bohemian/rocker vs prim, & flowy vs structured). it will be in regular rotation for years. it's slim through the shoulders and arms, and flowing everywhere else. love the pockets. the fabric is light, but i love in so cal, so it's great. i'm wearing it right now with gray skinnies, heeled clogs, and a scarf. i'll also wear it all summer as a dress. so perfect. i'm 5'4, 140lb, 34b, and the 8 fits perfectly.",0
3,53,Darling dress,"I just purchased this cute dress on sale and made sure to size down one size so instead of my regular small, i ordered an extra small which fits me perfectly. i'm a petite yet busty 34d-27-35 and 5'4"" and think the dress looks adorable on especially since i'm a huge fan of all things plaid. it's a lighter weight dress so it's perfect for spring or summer but can be worn in fall/winter with this color scheme by adding tights, boots and a sweater or jacket. i also love that it has pockets. i don't",1
3,54,,"The dress is cute, but i'm somewhat concerned that it will be sheer in the sunlight. i guess we'll have to wait and see!",0
3,56,,"Very pretty color (slightly darker than on my computer), a bit like a light periwinkle/lavender... embroidery is lovely and the dress has a fresh spring-like quality. the style is a basic shift, but the color and details make up for the straight shape. great dress for the spring/summer months. good quality and was a nice deal on sale!",4
3,57,Embroidered masterpiece,This dress is so beautifully embroidered with really cool mix of colors. it is pricey but i do think it will stand the test of time and become an retailer vintage piece. planning to wear it now with wedges and in the fall with booties and a light sweater.,1
3,61,Looks like a babydoll dress,"I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however, the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else. 

sadly, dress had to be returned.",0
3,61,,"This dress is beautifully made, but it does not flair slightly as in the photo, it stick out like a tent. it might be a good maternity dress. the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture.",0
3,62,Pretty and flattering,,0
3,66,"Quality look, sizing off.","This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size, but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty, but background is more of a muddy gray, then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available, i'd have exchanged it, but it is going back.",1
3,69,Love this dress,This dress is so cute and comfortable. i'm normally a 0 or 2 and the xs is plenty roomy even though this is a clingy knit. the nice cotton under slip hides all the bumps and bulges. only worry is whether or not the loose weave will pick and how it will clean but so far i am thrilled.,2
3,70,Gorgeous!,"Love this dress. it is simultaneously romantic, sexy and sweet. could be a casual dress but also worn with heels. it does run a little large but it is flowy and not meant to be super tight. i am 36d and the top isn't too tight - ordered the size 4 and am very happy with the fit.",4
4,28,Wanted to love but...,"I wanted to love this dress but there were too many factors that ultimately had me sending it back.

it is a very unique piece and high quality; however, i have sensitive skin c/o irish genes, and something about the silk/linen/sequin combo had be itching like crazy and really irritated my skin. i also did not love the way the top part of the dress layed on me- it was like there was a bit too much fabric up top meanwhile fitting perfectly around my hips (so i wouldn't want to size down...)",5
4,32,Stunning dress,,4
4,33,Poor quality,This is another item i've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn't even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.,1
4,34,Absolutely beautiful,"I almost never buy anything full price here and usually wait patiently for a sale + promotion :) however, this really struck me and i decided to buy it, telling myself it's an investment piece for years to come. it's just so unique and beautiful -- the things that makes retailer unique that aren't as common anymore.

4,34,Sizing and fit are off,"Absolutely love the print and quality is great too! unfortunately, for a well endowed woman like myself, it runs terribly small in the bust and hip region. it absolutely does not look as flowy on an hourglass body type. too bad because it's beautiful! might try sizing up but doubt it will work :(",28
4,35,I love this dress,"I have had a lot of complements while wearing this dress. i purchased it in the grey. other reviews felt that this dress ran large. i agree that it might be a little larger than other retailer purchases i have made but not by much. i purchased it in small (usually what i wear in dresses) i'm very tall at 5'9"" (mostly legs) and the length is great. also the neck line is perfect on me and i have a fairly average torso length. . i am very happy with the purchase.",0
4,35,,"This dress runs very large. i am 5'4 and 120 lbs, hourglass, curvy build. i ordered a size small and its enormous on me. the description says fitted but it is not fitted at all. it's like a big wool sack. i'd have to gain 30 lbs for this dress to come close to fitting. i'm very sad that the fit is so far off and the dress is now all sold out in all smaller sizes, including petite.

4,36,Dress is extremely pear-shaped.,"I bought this dress in an xs, and am 5'4"", 115 lbs, and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug, but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side.",21
4,38,Perfect winter dress!,I came into the store to try another dress on and was given this dress to try. it is perfect! i paired it with black tights and tall boots for a family photo. i got it in the wine color. highly recommend and very fun for winter. it does run really large. i usually wear a small but got an extra small.,12
4,39,Just ok for mw,"I love the pattern, but the color was not great on my skin tone. i tried on the regular size and it wasn't great. teh cut could work, but overall, i didn't feel like it was enough for me to order the petite to see, and i sometimes do. in a tall darker toned person, this would be gorgeous. what i like the most is the color pattern in the print, and shimmer.",0

4,40,Wished it fit,Loved that this was an 100% boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large. i tried the small and extra small - both were really large in the hips. i will maybe try the xxs - was hoping to make this is winter staple.,0
4,41,Beautiful sweater dress,"I love this dress so much that i purchased it in both grey and wine. i find the cut very flattering and slimming, and love the pockets. it works great for northern california winters, with tights, boots, boiled wool sweatercoat over it while outdoors, and on its own indoors. i wish there was a long-sleeved version. i feel exceptionally cute and cozy while wearing it. good job, sparrow! btw, i bought the other currently offered sparrow wool dress (the mock-neck dress), and this one is just an inc",0
4,41,Classy and practical,"I purchased this beauty in the sophisticated dark green on black friday and it has been in constant rotation. it looks chic and classy, feels comfortable and warm. i only wish it was about 2 inches longer, i'm 5'5 and it hits at low thigh, i prefer just above the knee for a winter dress. very practical for walking around city all day and then being ready for a dinner or drinks in style. love it.",0
4,44,Gorgeous,"This is a dress for a princess. i admire this dress so much, online and in person. i tried on this dress a few times every time i visited the store. the beads throughout the dress provide a low-key surprise sparkle, especially in the sun. the colors are much more vibrant in person, which is breathtaking against the light cream background. the fabric is soft and flowy. unfortunately for me, it doesn't fit right. size 6 fits well but the arm holes are too big and the midi part makes me look frumpy",2

4,47,Lovely print and fabric design,"This dress was stunning on the hanger -- on me not so much. i am 5' 1.5"" and typically a sz 2. the smallest size at the store was a 4. i felt it was baggy about the waist and the length would have been better in petite sizing. the print is gorgeous with beading accenting different flowers. there is a tinge of green-yellow to the background fabric and the color did not look good on me. i hope to try this in a 4p.",30
4,47,Not the usual retailer quality.,"I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they're very soft and very well made, hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress.",3
4,47,"Warm dress, with a few issues.","First, i love wool. if it's 100% wool, i love it. if wool isn't your thing, then this dress isn't for you. i ordered this dress online in the burgundy. it is not itchy. it falls above my knees and i am 5'3"". it is warm and cozy with pockets, which i love. with the sleeves being short, i am wearing a long, frilly cardigan over it. i ordered the small (did not notice a size chart with this product). i am usually a size 4 or 6. it fits great in the bodice, but runs large through the hips. however,",9

4,50,"Warm dress, slightly itchy","I got this dress in the green in an xs and was a little leary of the fit in light of the previous review. however, when i tried it on, i was impressed how it felt in the upper torso - it fit great in the neck, arms and shoulders. and i didn't find the rest of the dress to be too roomy, although it wasn't a snug fit either. it came below the knee on me, but it didn't bother me that it was slightly longer than in the modeling pics. it is a little on the itchy side so, it may be best to wear a cami",5
4,56,Beautiful dress,"I ordered this in a 2, but returned for a 4 because the arm holes were a little tight. other than that, this is a absolutely flattering dress. u will be wearing it for an outdoor garden wedding shower. the beading around the flowers makes such a different accent. just be careful zipping it up. love it!",2
4,56,Tight and cheap looking,,0
4,63,Large and thin,"I bought this for an upcoming conference and was grateful that it shipped very promptly.

it runs quite large, in my opinion. i'm 5'7"" and about 130-135lbs. the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms. the stomach also wasn't very fitted. the material is thinner than i expected (you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light), but i don't think this is a problem, necessarily. had it been thicker, it probably would be too warm. but you might need a slip",82
4,83,Paris runway dress!,"I have a closet full of dresses and very few have the quality and attention to detail as this gorgeous dress!
often times when ordering online the dress that you actually receive will have a different fabric placement than the online photos.......and it can detract from the overall look.....but the one that i received is exactly as pictured. the gold details hit in all the right places.
the quality is shocking! looks like a $2000 dress.
true to size however, the chest/bust runs a little big.",0
5,33,The brown/gray version is cropped,"The photos don't look it, but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3"" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall. 

disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!",2
5,35,Cheesy...,"I agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very ""80's""!! online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors, but in person it's a bad overly-fuzzy christmas sweater with super bright 80's colors!! if you're going for kitschy / tacky / retro this may work for you, but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo you'll be disappointed... :( it looked to be true to size, but to be honest i hated it so much i didn't even try it on.",2
5,41,Perfect for fall,"This sweater is just as pictured. the fit is true to size, though it is a looser style rather than fitted sweater. it is short, though not cropped, and the sleeves are 1-2"" too long, but it is still flattering. it hits at the top of my hip and it looks great with high-waisted flares. the scallop detail is perfect, just enough interest, but not overbearing. the material is soft and heavier than expected. it is a good weight for fall. i wish it was made of natural fibers instead of synthetics, but",0
5,46,Great sweater,"I saw someone else wearing this sweater and had to find it! i'm 5'5""and 118 lbs and ordered the small. the back of the sweater hits a few inches above my back pockets. i've been wearing it with a tank underneath and it's been the perfect sweater for fall weather. i was worried the poncho effect might make it hard to wear this sweater with a jacket but it's actually less bulky than other ""real"" sweaters i have.",0
5,62,Wow!,I do not know where to begin....this sweater exceeds my expectation! i ordered this along with the mes demoiselles fringed sweater and i thought that was the game stopper....as beautiful as that one is...this one made my mouth fall open. it is unlike anything i have. it is an oversized substantial chic piece that is all over the runways. not to mention the color that i can not stop staring at and it will go with everything! order your regular size as it is suppose to be big!,0
6,24,Its okay,The pattern of this skirt is adorable and looks better in person but the fabric isnt the best. it feels like an elastic fabric and is way to volumous. overall not my favorite.,0
6,29,Beautiful skirt,"I love everything about this skirt, except that it adds bulk to the waist and/or hip area because of lots of fabric and pleating.   i still love it and when i place the waist band higher on my waist looks super cute with a dainty blouse tucked in.   i'm 5'4 105 and have a tiny belly  pooch that comes and goes through out the day so although this skirt is beautiful it tends to magnify the tiniest of belly pooches and hips.  i think i love the skirt too much to retun.",2

6,31,Stylish,"I got this skirt because its elegant and can be worn in three seasons. it is stylish and can easily be dressed up or down. i usually wear an xs in bottoms and this runs about one size large in the waist area. still, i am keeping it and plan to have it altered. it is cute and completely worth the extra effort",0
6,32,,"I wanted to love this skirt and i agree with the other reviewers. the color of the skirt is beautiful. i've never seen anything quite like it at retailer! the quality is superb and the material is fairly substantial given the brocade design. however, the skirt made my hips look a lot bigger than they are because the shape of the skirt is more of a tulip-design. i purchased an 0 petite (because my normal size 00 petite was sold out) and while the waist part fit the hip part was disproportionately l",4

6,36,Better in person,"This skirt has a beautiful, flattering feminine fit. the floral pattern is delicate and a little different and, of course, the layers are what make this piece a stunner. i highly recommend it. can see wearing this all year, dressed up with jewels, or down with boots and a casual sweater.",5
6,36,Stunning emerald color - great holiday party skirt,The colors in this skirt are gorgeous. a super pretty emerald/green color with graphic silver and black flowers. this skirt can be dressed up or dressed down. i'm loving the idea of wearing black tights and flat boots with it to make it casual or wearing it with tights and heels for a holiday party. the weight of the skirt isn't heavy so i think with the right colors can wear it in spring too.,2
6,38,Full skirt,"I ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model. this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out. it is a whole lot of skirt! i'm 5'2"" and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up.  i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me. it would work on someone taller.",1
6,41,Sian mini skirt,"So there weren't any product reviews to go by when i ordered the last small. i had no way of knowing if it ran big, small, or tts. i'm usually a med, but to my surprise the small worked due to the fluid pleating. it sits right on my natural waistline similar to the model and not too short in length (i'm 5'8""). i also like the med weight of the fabric it moves freely when you walk, but not too light. it is similar to a double weight georgette or crepe.",0

6,53,Runs small would be a bit of an understatement...,It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small,1

7,24,Beautiful material and back crochet,"I saw this in the store and grabbed it to try on due to the material and the back. i was surprised how nice it felt on and how the back looked. i had a blue bra on and it really could not be seen which was a worry. i loved how the back lay and that it was shorter in the front. even for the sale price it was expensive, but i went home with it!! it will go great with long skirts, jeans, and any color pants. i was very happy to walk out of the store with it. i am 5'4"" and about 120. i have a slende",0
7,24,"Pretty, but not for me...","I bought this top online in the burnt orange color and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on, the fit was fine but it just lacked...something. the back was a little bit too long, the front was a little bit too short and it lacked the overall tailored look that i was after. gorgeous fabric and top, but not for me. i wanted something more for $150! bought the velvet tunic instead ;)",3
7,24,Too studious for words,"Love this blouse. the owl design is flawless front to back. the material has a silk like feeling. i would say the arms a slightly tighter than i would prefer. if you have larger arms or have any muscle the sleeves may be tight on you. also, i am a 38 c and the chest fit well (in size large), but would not offer much more room for a larger chest. if you want a looser and relaxed fit as the model shows, i would size up. i love the unique design!",10
7,25,Cute and stylish,"I bought this top in hopes of getting a lot of wears out of it as we transition from summer to fall. the color is a pretty rust color perfect for fall, but also great for late summer. i love the leaf print, and the dark buttons on the sides really take the top to the next level. i love wearing this top with my high-waisted flare jeans, i get tons of compliments when i wear this top! it is definitely sheer, which i like, so i wish that it came with its own detachable camisole (the reason i took a",1

7,29,Beautiful top,"This is a beautiful top but the fit is odd. it's roomy and flowy in the bust and waist but the arms are disproportionately tight. i wear a size 8 in all hd in paris tops but this one didn't fit anything like the others. i wouldn't even know what size to recommend because it's almost too big in the body, while being too tight in the arms. the lace and mock neck is beautiful though so i'm hoping to find someway to wear it comfortably. otherwise, it will be going back.",0

7,29,,"I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff, it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.",0
7,30,Love it!,"Yes it is boxy, but by design. because it is a shorter length and sheer it isn't an issue for me even as a petite. it has a bit of an ethereal look on as if it's just floating on your body. what doesn't show well in online pictures are beautiful chartreuse, charcoal & white threads running throughout the design. this adds to the classy look of this top.
great to dress up jeans or with a dressy pencil skirt for a night out.",0
7,31,"Cute idea, bad cut",I wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer. but it's almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short. the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically. had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve.,14
7,31,Must see in person,"Gorgeous baby blue lace is a must see. i received many compliments. my only gripe is that i don't love when shirts have those connecting camisoles (which make it harder to put on) as i would much rather just have a sewn in lining, but it didn't deter me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, muscular/curvy frame and a size 4 fit perfectly.",2
7,31,Not as pictured,It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.,6
7,32,Adorable,"I purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it. i found it to be pretty true to size, even after washing. it's a little sheer, so you'd definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work. it's a great top for spring/summer!",4
7,33,Fit issues for a curvy gal,"First off, the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling, the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however, i just couldn't get past the fit issue, which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest, and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me, but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else, but i had to ret",16
7,33,Flowy perfection!,"I have to admit, seeing these tops online, i wouldn't give them a second glance, but at my local store they were displayed in a gorgeous summery fashion and were so light and airy and flowy (my summer checklist!) i bought both the blue and rust color in an xl. i am a 16/xl/36h and this is one of the few button up shirts that actually fit! i think i might go in and add a snap between the bust line anyway since the buttons are spaced too generously, but there is no pulling. this top does run long,",7
7,33,"So cute, but size up!!","This top is so cute and of spectacular quality, but you have to size up! i'm a 10/m/34c all the time. i almost never have to size up or down. but this top was so tight around the bust that i couldn't possibly have closed the zipper in the back. i'm sending it back for a l in the hopes of a better fit. the coloring of the owls is out-of-this-world cute, so i'm keeping my fingers crossed that a larger size will be just right.",1
7,33,So cutest,Ok. love this top. i'm 5'4 106 34b and the 0 reg fits perfect on the top half. i am going to have the waist taken in because i love the top. it is very short. i usually need a petite but the regular is just barely long enough. i thought it was red and white but it is red and beige. great with jeans or navy for work.,1

7,35,Love it... but size up!,"I love this top and was so happy when it came out in black! i'm typically an 8 on top and sized up to a 10, and it still feels slightly small across the shoulders and arms. it also requires a under tank because it's very sheer, even with the lining. worth it though!",0

7,35,Staple with a twist,"Love the crochet detail on the back. yes, it does show the bottom band of your bra. i think i'm okay with that. i had on a magenta colored bra when i tried this on and it was a nice pop of color. i think the top runs tts to slightly big. if you're in between sizes i would go down. i am a 34b and i ordered a size 4. so i haven't tried on the 2 but i think it would fit too and not be quite as loose in the arm hole area. i'm sure this top will sell out before it hits sale.",4

7,48,Flattering cut,"Love this top! it hits at the top of the waist & is very flattering. the fabric is thicker than i thought it would be and had a deep texture. when i first took it out of the package, i thought it would be a ""send-back"" because it looked kind of square & shapeless. but once on, it took on a whole other look.",0
7,48,Lovely interesting white top,"I bought this in my usual size small, and love it. looks great with skinnies or pencil skirts. not sheer enough to need a cami, but enough to look cottony and breezy. very elegant. it falls flatteringly on my shape - 34c, 28-38, 5'3"". it has an elegant, arty vibe. if you have a long torso or big chest, i would say try it on in the store to make sure the chest area falls well for you.",6

7,49,"Unique and comfortable top, easy to wear.","I love the beading at the neck of this top and also the half-length banded sleeves. it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear. it looks like silk although it is synthetic. i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me, but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and you're done and ready for work or going out to an event. it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built",1
7,50,Beautiful and elegant tank,"I totally disagree with previous reviewer on sizing. i am usually a medium (sometimes small) in various retailer tops and i purchased this top in a small. i could barely get it over my head. i then ordered the medium and large. i tried the large on first and it fits perfectly.

7,58,Meh,"This tunic is way over priced for the style and quality. it fit comfortably (runs a size larger) but it's not really flattering, it jut kind of hangs there looking ok. it is a little too deep of a v cut for a work top as well. this top does not support the price at all. it felt like something i could find at department store for way less. i will be returning it.",12

7,66,A bit underwhelmed,"I hoped to love this based on the prior review, but i didn't. it's a beautifully crafted top but the print didn't look good on me. and although i grabbed during the sale it's too expensive to keep when it's not perfect.",1
7,66,Beautiful,I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you're well endowed. it's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs. haven't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized (but cozy) and it's really long. it almost touches the top of my knees in back. sooooo pretty though.,0

10,44,Not flattering on me...,"I am 5'4"" about 120# with an athletic build. i was so excited for this dress to arrive. when i removed it from the package i loved the way it felt and the weight of it. the color was as pictured on my computer. i ordered the xsp and was concerned it would be too small in the shoulders or too short. it was huge on me -- too long -- too wide -- too frumpy -- too loose all over. i checked to make certain it was a petite that was sent and it was. boo. i do like the cap sleeve better than the flutter",1
10,45,Cute....but,"This is a cute, flattering dress, however the drop-waist, the short length and the odd-length sleeves (shorter than shown in the photos!!!) added up to me feeling like i was dressing way to young. it just didn't convey an elegant, mature vibe. this dress is perfect for a 20s-30s woman who wants a versatile dress to wear on many occasions. it's great because it's not too expensive and you could wear it with any type of shoes.

10,49,Casual chic dress,"I like the natural fiber of this dress- both the lining and outer layer are comfortable, breathable cotton. the dress has a casual contemporary vibe with the plaid weave and asymmetrical hem, but is surprisingly fitted in some areas. the bust of the xsp was too tight for me, and as a 34 b i don't usually have the problem of being too busty for my clothes. i normally wear an xsp in a dress that seems loose and flowy like this one, but this dress is more fitted than you might suspect from the webs",1

14,59,Beautiful!,"Ordered this coat in a small. it is meant to be a slouchy and the fit is perfect - i'm 5'5"" and weigh around 120. the sleeves are slightly longer than 3/4. the fabric is so soft, the coat is unlined and drapes beautifully. this coat reminds me of a coat my mother had when i was a child.... she referred to it as her 'car coat'... i believe that was a style then. worth the $.",1
14,61,Cute and fun!,,0
15,39,Fun and different,"I love this cardigan, it is very soft, and unique (i am a sucker for polka dots). i tried on my usual size (xs) and it fit. i wish they did have it in petite, however. added this one to my wish list :-)

soft, versatile.",6
15,39,Love love love,"Quality, length, size, design are all perfect! i'm sometimes a picky person, but i can't say one thing less about this cardigan. it's all wool, but it feels so soft and comfortable. and it doesn't wrinkle. i put it in my purse for a couple of hours, still great when taken out. thin, but don't you plan to wear something underneath? it goes with everything!",0
15,49,Pure love,"I absolutely love this light, soft cardigan. i don't think the pic does it justice. the black longer blouse takes away from it. i wore it to work with a white button down and received so many compliments. only wish it came in additional colors.",0
15,49,Very cute cardigan,"I tried this on in the store and came online for the petite size. the length was fine on me, it's only the sleeves that would be better for me in petite. this cardigan is very cute. the dots are a bit more arty-looking in ""person"" than you can see here - more like watercolor or ink spots, which is a nice subtle touch. i put ""runs small"" just because i think you might want to size up if you plan on wearing much in the way of layers underneath. the merino wool is not itchy, it is nice and soft. i",8
15,54,"Cute cardigan, fun piece","This is a cute, fun addition to my wardrobe, especially since i am a polka dot fan! it is alittle short for me and i think it runs just a bit small, particularly if you want to wear like the model with longer shirt under it. overall, it was worth the sale price and will look good with casual pants, jeans and with dressier black pants for work.",2
15,55,,Couldn't resist the polka dots! very cute and stylish cardi. since i'm short waisted this cropped style is perfect for me. i tried on the xs and small and while there wasn't a huge difference i went with the small since it had a bit more room. it's pricey so i waited for a sale to purchase!,2
15,62,Lightweight cashmere,"I have only worn this 3 times with no signs of pilling, yet. it is good for cool spring days/evenings. for me, it'll be the cooler 3-seasons sweater. i wear a size large and it fits properly. i have worn lightweight long sleeve knit tees under this with ease in the sleeves. i think a slim sleeved shirt/blouse would work equally well. while i like the idea of the pockets, i think they'll stretch out easily beyond a tissue or quick hand warming. i removed 1 star due to the high price and i receive",0
15,93,Very pretty & soft,Great quality. very versatile design and super cute. runs small - i ordered up a size which was perfect.,0
16,22,Very flattering!,"Great fit! for reference, i am 5'7"", 160 lbs and bought a size medium. there is a piece of fabric that acts as a cami underneath to prevent any unwanted reveal with the lace up. soft fabric and falls beautifully!",0
16,23,Very versatile,"I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it's warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length.",0
16,25,Cute in theory,"This is a gorgeous top; however, it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?",23
16,25,I wish i had bought it in every color,,1
16,32,Super cute!,"I really love this shirt. the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style. i thought the fit was perfect - i'm 5'5"", 120lbs and i ordered an xs. still enough room to be comfortable. super cute! glad i bought it.",2
16,33,Stiff material,"I found the material a little stiff, im asummig linen is stiff at first. i got an xxs and fit tts in my case (34 b, 5'7, 120 lb).",3
16,35,Western shirt with a feminine flare,"This shirt is actually not as fitted as it looks on the model. the shirt actually flares out a bit and giving more room to large chested women, like myself. the arms and chest area are a tat small, but the non-fitted style accommodated that nicely. great color, great design with the butterflies and easy to wash. looks great with skinny bell bottoms or even jean shorts in the summer and some cowboy boots. very sexy.",1
16,41,Very short shirt - gorgeous for shorter folks!,"I loved this shirt online and went to my local retailer store the other day and wanted to try it on. i didn't even get past the ""hold it up and measure the length"" test we tall people often do, as it was incredibly short. there is no way i could wear this shirt at 5'11"". 

unless you have a short torso and want to rock the (icky) high-waisted pants that are everywhere right now, this beautiful top might not work for you.

oh, and it's sheer. camisole needed for white and navy.",21
16,42,Darling top!,"Love this top! such a fun pattern and style. soft too! easily paired with a sweater or light weight denim/cargo jackets for fall. i generally wear an xs in retailer tops and purchased this in a 2 which is a perfect fit. it could be a tad more roomy in the chest, however the 4 would be too big overall.",1
16,43,Well made cute top,"So this top is kind of short, but that is pictured. it hits right where it does in the photo, which i like. it is a sheer material, not terribly so, but you will most likely need a cami, which you could pair a long one with to offset the shorter top if you don't like the shortness. i love the top, it's very pretty detailing, cute, just as pictured. i ordered a size 2 and it fits great. i usually wear petites, but you really don't need to get a petite because it's short as it is. i have broad sho",1
16,44,Much thinner,,3
16,45,Love it,I have to agree with previous reviewers in that it is a bit short on the top but i kind of like that as i am petite and most tops come way too long on me; however go up a size if you have any breasts at all. likely they will not fit in you standard size. however i just love this shirt. soooo adorable. the color is a bit more olive than brown to me though than what is in the pic :),1
16,48,Buy this shirt before it sells out,This was the best purchase of the summer. it's cute and comfortable without being too baggy/loose. i get compliments every time i wear it. fits true to size. i bought the floral (orange) one. couldn't be happier!,0
16,52,Cute but not for me,"Beautiful in white, and beautiful to look at, but as the other reviewer mentioned, the fabric is very sheer and see thru. not a deal breaker if worn over a cami; however, the reason i am returning it is the fit. there is too much fabric flaring right at my waist. it looks like a tent on me. in addition, some of the beading is already coming off, and i can't imagine what it will look like after one wash. that's too bad, but i can't justify paying this much money for a sweet top that is beautiful",13
16,53,Gorgeous white blouse,I love a good white blouse and this shirt does not disappoint. the detailing of the lace and bead work make it extra special. i just love it. it can be dressed up or worn with jeans. it runs a bit wide. i normally don't buy a petite in tops because i am long in the body but i did with this one after i tried the regular.,1
16,54,Don't miss this top,"This is a great top and worth the money. nice flow to it, soft material and light weight for hot summer days. many light weight tops are sheer and require a cami - this one does not which is key for those of us that live in hot climates. don't miss out!",3
16,56,Darling summer top,"I usually try to avoid paying full price for items but saw this in the store and couldn't pass it up! tried it on in my usual size, 2p, and had to have it. i bought the white/black one, and it looks great with black capris. fabric is lightweight and airy; perfect for hot summer days.",1
16,60,Cute top,Purchased this top at my local store. usually don't pay full price for clothing but had to have this top. so cute and lightweight. love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra. usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect. suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase. i bought the floral design.,0
16,60,,"This is one of my favorite tops! it is comfortable and an easy ""throw and go"" top. i am a big fan of denim tops and the lace on the back gives it that extra detail and flare. very pleased :)",0
16,63,Pretty shirt!,I loved the cut out features on the shoulders of this shirt. it has the palest tone as pictured and will be cute with jeans this summer and on vacation. i took one star away because the body is cut rather large. i tested the center back fit and that was fine. i wish the body was a little more narrow.,5
16,64,Adorable top,I ordered my usual size 6 in tops at retailer in both the orange/blue print & the pink color. fit is tts & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. lightweight & cool for these hot days. the 'pink' really is not pink - it's a true orange so i returned this one. i didn't really need an orange top. if it had been as in the pic which is a pink/coral-like color i wld have kept it. the orange/blue print is really appealing so that is a keeper. this top is a little flowy but not tent-like which is perfect,16
16,65,,Love this shirt. i can dress it up or down. great fit,0
16,67,Very versatile,"I bought a similar shirt from this same manufacturer in blue and i've returned for another. i love it because you can layer it. you can wear this over a colored shirt and the color will show through the designs in the yoke. it looks great with bright colors. yes, it wrinkles easily but i am hoping that it will wrinkle less each time it is washed.",0
17,23,Better on the hanger,"I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail, and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey, but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer, so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms, small on body. odd fit.",7
17,26,"Beautiful top, but very thin","This top has a beautiful pattern, and the color is gorgeous - just like the photo. it is very thin, but under a sweater or blazer in the fall/winter would be perfect. it is a little big! i would order a size down.",0
17,26,Too sheer,"I bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints. however, they are too sheer. i don't want to wear a tank top, but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer. i can also see the fabric tearing easily, it is too delicate. i sent both colors back. what a waste because the prints and colors are good. these tops are also not for busty ladies. i have a big bust, and the top part didn't cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st",2
17,28,Meh,,6
17,33,,It's a beautiful top but not for bigger busts. ordered an xl and the top part would not button. i recommend for those with smaller busts.,0
17,37,,Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.,2
17,39,For the lanky models,"I so badly wanted this top to work. it looks so cute! but, as soon as i tried it on, i knew it wasn't a keeper. i didn't even need a mirror! it's not suited for those of us with a bust (i'm a 34d) and anything but a lanky model-esque frame. i suggest sizing up if you're busty and want to give it a try. it looked dowdy on me.",0
17,41,Fun and flowy,,0
17,41,Stunning!,Love this tunic...and so do others! so many compliments already!! i've worn it with skinny jeans as well as flowy black pants. it needs a cami underneath since it's sheer. i also like to wear it with my long retailer necklaces!,0
17,43,Disappointing!,"Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2"" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it's going back!",0
17,44,,Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom. i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out. this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars.,2
17,46,Perfect fit for xl,"I ordered both colors in size xl and they're each now favorite purchases. the fit is true to size--it matches the photos. the orange/white/brown/red combo works great with the orange version of the indra tassel necklace.

the tops are sheer so i wear a tank underneath. the green floral version will have some variations because of pattern placement. both are so unique & charming! i've been pairing them with different retailer cardigans & necklaces. they've washed well too--in a mesh bag on gentle &",0
17,46,"Romantic print, elegant & beautiful - i love it!","Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso, so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print, it is very flowy but i don't think it's too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic, girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short, just right. i took a medium, i am 5'8"" and athletic.",4
17,47,Just as pictured,"I took the advice of the other reviewer and ordered a medium in this (32d, 31"" waist, 38.5"" hips) instead of my usual small. it fits perfectly--a tiny bit loose like on the model. i bought the beige. you need a camisole underneath but the layered effect is very pretty. it is a delicate material which is why i gave it 4 stars. i can't speak to the quality of it, but will definitely use a hand wash cycle and line dry it. very pleased.",1
17,49,Beautiful,I saw both of these blouses several months earlier and anxiously waited for them to go on sale. definitely worth the wait. the quality and designs are superb true to size,0
17,49,Cute but...,"I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back, however, the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front, but i was really wanting the back to lo",9
17,49,"Nice style, but had some issues...","I love the contemporary style of this piece, but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me (5'1""). but if you don't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms, it might work for you. the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces.",0
17,50,Feminine top,"What originally attracted me to this top was the rich floral print with the stunning and vibrant colors. however, the colors in this blouse are more vintage autumn than actually pictured on this model. although, the colors are darker, you can still wear many things with this blouse. the top is floaty but doesn't look like a tent! i feel ultra feminine and comfortable in it. definitely a top that you need for that ""something special"" but it is not too dressy or not too casual...just perfect! don'",2
17,52,"Exquisite blouse, runs huge","I normally wear a large or extra-large; the medium is still very billowy on me. this blouse is ethereal and lovely, though - pretty and funky at the same time. it's sheer but somehow not revealing. perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer.",1
17,53,Lovely printed blouse,I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri,4
17,54,A standout,"This is a beautiful blouse...sheer and feminine. i am small busted and slender so i need a size smaller than usual. it is a full top...can't tell exactly how full in the photos but with a small chest there is just too much under the arms. so if your chest is more ample you could prob order your regular size. this is supposed to be a full, shorter fit...i would say the style is going to look better on someone who is a little taller with a medium sized bust rather than someone who is shorter and b",13
17,66,Amazing,"Ordered this on a whim, in my normal size large, and so glad i did. it's just beautiful. the color is a tea stained white background with soft grey blue and cinnamon colored tiny flowers. it has a soft, fairy princess vibe that could be dressy or casual. the 3/4 sleeves have elastic. it just flows nicely over the body and isn't oversized like so many tops. there's a ruffle with a slight peplum in the back. it's a beauty.",9
17,69,Ruffled buttondown,"Very pretty blouse. i love the print, and color of the pink floral. tts, i ordered the xs, because of the roomy cut of the blouse. i'm 5'8"", 117 lbs. it fit great. the cut is a little wider then pictured, but still cute. not to short as mentioned by another review, and i have a longer torso, i wasn't crazy about the victorian collar, so tucked it under, and it looks great!",7
18,21,,"Loved this top, but had to return it. the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality",0
18,36,Stinkin cute,Love this sweater! i almost passed it up on-line because i didn't notice the snails. the sweater is navy and the snails are black. they are so cute and such a fun and unique little accent. the material is a moderate to light-weight sweater. the length was perfect. i have inadvertently purchased a bunch of cropped sweaters this year - this one is not cropped - yay!! the sleeves are actually a bit on the long side. i sized up a little with the idea of wearing it over long sleeved tops. i am typica,3
18,38,Unique sweater,I tried it in the store but was not the true size so i ordered online. i wore it only once so far and got lots of compliments. very unique design.,0
18,50,Better in person,"This sweater is way cuter in person. the picture online does not really show the adorable contrast of the snails to the rest of the sweater. also, it looks like they photoshopped out the fact that the buttons run the whole length of the front. really cute and soft (not itchy). highly recommend",4
18,53,Picture a tad misleading....,"If you look closely at the photos, the buttons are only shown as applied halfway down the placket but the buttons run the entire length of this fabulous sweater by moth. the sweater fits tts; i am 5'5"" 142 lbs and the m is just perfect with room to wear more than an average tight fitting tee underneath. it is a mid-weight nylon-viscose-cashmere knit with understated black cotton 'rope' snails on the pockets. there's nothing boring about it as is often the case with long-sleeved, navy blue cardig",2
18,55,Too bad,"I just got this in the mail the other day. i was really excited and then crushed. one, buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo. it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling. it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours. i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail. it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back. too bad but not what i bought and then not",0

19,26,Nice but large,"I love this top. the design is very good, i love the pleats at the back, and i tried both colors. i prefer blue even though both look good. the fit is very loose mainly due to the pleats at the back. i usually wear xl but bought this in an l, which was also very loose. i think an m would be too tight across the shoulders but loose lower because of the pleats. i am keeping the blue because i like this style, with fitted pants it would work well.",2

19,34,Not worth full price!,"I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately, i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that, it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all, i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!",6
19,35,Didnt love it,"While there is nothing wrong with this top, it didn't really have an retailer feel. it looked more like something from a dept store, maybe a boutique. i got on sale but sending back bc i just don't like it that much, especially next to my pale skin. i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone. i'm usually a 8/10 med. small in this top fit well.",2

19,36,Feminine and romantic,"This blouse is very flattering. it drapes well and i love the textures. only problem is the head hole is a little small so if you buy the white one, put your makeup on after you have it on and remove your makeup before sliding it off. i bought an extra small even though i'm usually a small. lovely top. a lot of people have commented on it.",1
19,36,Ready for clown college!,"This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more.

19,48,Lovely tank for fall,This tank caught my eye in the store yesterday. i was taken by the design contrast of the front and back. the colors are beautiful and rich. i see this as the perfect tank to transition into the fall season. the top does run a little big. i sized down to a medium. i am just under 5'5 and am a 36g.,1

19,66,Nope,There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.,0

22,67,Fun unique jacket,Purchased for myself and loved the fabric and unique design. it runs very large and the size smaller was not available so it was returned.,0
22,67,Lots of style,"This is a great coat, very lightweight, but warm. the color is gorgeous. it is fitted at the waist with fullness below and a great length. i am writing this review to give a heads up about the sizing. by usual retailer sizing this runs small and short waisted. i am generally an retailer x small and i need to exchange this one for a small or maybe even a medium (if i want to wear much underneath it). as it is it fits too well, like a dress, not a coat and looks short waisted. in fact, when i tr",26
22,67,Sooo flattering!,"I have a narrow face, and most coats with the big collars overwhelm me. this proportion is perfect. follows my shape without constricting but flows so well for a good line. color isn't quite laden green; it's more teal which works even better for me. so hard to find a wool coat these days that isn't bulky.",3
22,69,Beautiful jacket,"I bought this online in dark green after trying on the burgundy. i usually wear a medium (5'2"", 120) but i looked better in the small in this jacket. the combination of very deep green, black and tan is beautiful. the cut is very flattering with the jacket open or snapped closed. it is nice enough to wear with black pants or skirt but looks just as good with jeans. i am in my 60's and this look is chic and fresh without being too ""young"" for my age. it's also very well made. i love it.",0
22,74,Fun sweater for the sale price,"This reminds me a bit of a vintage tennis sweater: wide-rib, v-neck; loose-fitting. nice creamy cotton blend. size was a bit hard to gauge. this sweater is long (lower hip length) and has dolman sleeves, so it has a quite roomy fit. however, i ordered the xs/s (my normal size), and it is scaled proportionately, so the fit is true.",2
23,32,Nice too but not what you expect from photo,I ordered my usual size and i think the length and the top (chest/arms) for great. however the bottom is more of a swing style than a straight or slight a-line as depicted in the stock photo. there is too much fabric in the stomach area and just not flattering.,2
23,43,Easy summer top,I love that this top is double layered so it prevents any sheerness. the cream colored trim on the white top is really pretty- great combo. has a shabby chic feel. the fit is nice through the shoulders and eases up through the body - not fitted which i like.,2

24,20,Lovely for a little while,"Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however, after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater, but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale.",1
24,21,Pretty but not for me,"This sweater is very pretty, i love the knit and the cream color. for some reason it just didn't flow the way i wanted it to, and i didn't love the v neck. just didn't pull me in completely!",1

24,22,Beautiful but a lot of sweater,"I loved this when i saw it online. tried it on in the store, and though it is beautiful, it's a lot of sweater. its a a bit heavy in weight, the buttons on the collar give you the option to wear it up or open as shown in the picture. the problem was that when it was open the big button loop hung down right in front. that was probably the determining factor against purchasing it. if it goes on sale i may reconsider.",10
24,23,Cocoony fit,"I agree with the other reviewer-- this is classic retailer old-style quality. the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical. the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist. i usually choose s/m in cardigans (for ref, 5'8"", 135 lbs, 34-b), but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me. i think it just depends what you are looking for. unique it is, and certainly lovely.",11

24,25,Awkward fit,"This sweater was a little bit of a let down. i ordered the pink and it is actually a tan sweater with (bright) coral material woven throughout. it wasn't the 'soft pink/coral' color that it appeared to be online. while the material is very cozy, the sweater itself is short and boxy. i would've like the width better if the length would've been a little more proportionate. i am 5' 0"" and ordered a petite small. probably returning.",0

24,33,Beautiful in light red,"The light red color is so rich! i would describe it as a burnt coral/red. i love the length - long enough to pair with leggings, but not overwhelming in my 5'3"" frame. one sleeve began to unravel the first time i wore it, but i was able to mend it easily and have had no trouble since. i think it was a flaw specific to my sweater and not s general indication if poor quality. hubby says this is his favorite sweater on me too!",0
24,33,Cozy,I tried this one on in the store and my typical xs fit perfect. it's not too boxy in the waist like every other sweater this season. also the mock neck is not to wide and is flattering. it sheds which i do not like but not as bad as some. the material is thin but warm i would layer it.,0
24,33,Cute,"I think this sweater is well executed for what it is--a chunky knit trapeze sweater. i agree with another reviewer that i would ignore this product online, but it caught my eye in person. there was only one of the pink sweaters left in store. the interwoven peachy, heathery color is sweet and flattering. since i'm 5'1"", i ordered had the petite version to try. hope it works out 'cuz i'm eager to own something relaxed and cozy that's actually flattering and isn't a sweatshirt.",0

24,45,Cozy sweater,"I passed this sweater a few times during a recent visit to retailer. after striking out on several items i thought would work, i grabbed this sweater in the cream color. i loved it as soon as i put it on! it is meant to be oversized, which i love. the neck is chunky and looks good open or buttoned all the way to make a loose turtleneck. looks great with skinny jeans and booties. i went with my usual xs. great purchase!",13
24,45,Love it,It does run large. i got it on sale and it is a great sweater / coat for $200.00. i would not have paid the full price of 450.00 but i do love it. every time i wear it someone complements me.,2
24,46,"Bulky, heavy and awkward",I ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl. it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. it also attracted so much lint. the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it. it added weight and was unflattering for my shape. the colors do match the photos online. the length also matches the model's photos. it just didn't work for me.,0
24,46,Enveloping cacoon of warmth,"I first saw this sweater coat in the retailer catalog that i got in the mail. i thought it was beautiful. so ethereal! i never thought that i would own it, though because of the initial price. i never thought it would make it to clearance. to my surprise, it did, and then went the extra 30% off! i took the plunge. i followed the advice of the other reviewers, and ordered a size down, a small. i am glad that i did. i still feel like i get the oversized, wrapped in warmth feel. it is not a figure fl",2
24,46,Gorgeous green,"I ordered the green version in size xl. i knew it was cropped and it fits me as shown on the models. so, i think that's true to size. the knit is very soft. but, it's the color that's amazing--such a rich bright emerald green! i love the look of it. it's awkward fitting on my pear-shape. i layer a long tank underneath with this on top. but, the hemline of the sweater cuts at an unflattering place. still, the softness and the beautiful color make it a staple in my closet. when i'm staying at home",0
24,46,"Soft, warm, & cozy","I was pleasantly surprised by this beautiful sweater! being that it's a wool blend, i thought it would be itchy against my skin. to my surprise, it is quite the opposite. very cozy and soft, with plenty of ""wiggle room"". i'm very tall and having enough length for my arms is always a concern. the sleeves are long and comfortable. this sweater is quickly becoming one of my new favorite ""go to"" pieces!",0

24,47,Awesome sweater for winter!,"After reading the reviews i was hoping to be able to try this on in store. i was able to try on a xxs and a xs in the store on the sale rack. i tried both on and i usually will take an xs or small in sweaters. funny, but the xxs seemed to be a little longer in the front and the fit is nicer on me. after reading others review of this sweater i thought for sure it would be super short on the xxs but it wasn't. just goes to show you should always try on first! i did not feel that the sleeves were l",0

24,47,Humongous,I found this as a return in the store. i tried the xxs. i was so excited because it looked really cute on the hanger. it was so huge- looked like i was wearing an xl.,3
24,47,Perfect sweater for chilly weather,Absolutely love this cardi! it's perfect with nice jeans and boots or my black pants. i am nearly 6' tall and a medium is plenty long in the sleeve and overall length. it adds warmth but it's breathable so it doesn't give you the super hot effect when going inside. they only reason i gave a 4 in quality is that it is loosely stitched so you can get caught on things :) otherwise it is a great addition to my closet!,0
24,47,"Super cute, but itchy!","I purchased this on sale, xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater, but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy, but i would say itchy and cozy!",0
24,48,Adorable !,"Love this zip cardigan with removable faux fur. it did not look like much on the hanger but once on it is soft , rich and just adorable, it can be dressed up or down, perfect for a finishing piece over a dress to wearing with jeans and skirts. the fabric is soft but substantial . the only negative for me is the zipper sticks a little. a plus it is a ivory shade and is a good basic. i chose my typical medium and fits perfect . 34 dd chest for reference. sale price plus promo made this a winner. i",1

24,48,Gorgeous style but very very itchy,"I love the style and the look of this sweater. i wanted to love it and keep it but could not because the itchiness was too much. the style looks so comfortable and easy going, but it was not, it was clingy around the waist and backside. for reference, i am 5ft 4in and 128b and i ordered the small - the sleeves were too long on me, not ""cool"" long like some other sweaters this season.",0
24,48,Gorgeous!!!!,"I love this sweater jacket! found it on the sale rack in a medium and fits like a medium would fit from my adored retailer! i am 5,4' inches and 34dd chest and curvy 145 lbs. the knitted detailed collar is a show stopper and what makes this item look like an an old school retailer item. the color is really not orange but more of a vintage rose with hints of rust and soft shades of pink. i love this color and i think it would look beautiful on many skin tones. i paired it with a pink blouse from anth",1

24,48,"Soft, cozy and stylish!","Absolutely love this sweater because it is so pretty while being soft and comfortable. i am 5'4"" and purchased the small?it falls a little below my hips. while the color matches everything, the pockets and details add a nice touch and the longer sleeves are cozy. the only drawback is it pills and sheds.",0
24,49,A signature piece,"Absolutely beautiful jacket...the craftsmanship is amazing, and the colors remind me of a impressionist water color. the jacket runs true to size (i'm 5'7"" and 115 pounds with a 30e bust and the extra small fit perfectly). unlike the other reviewers, i didn't have issue with the bottom not lying flat or the collar bunching up. i wore it with a green leather pencil skirt and suede stilettos, but you can also wear it with skinny jeans as well.i got this very deeply discounted, and although it is i",1

24,49,Nice swing sweater,"This sweater is heavier and has more of a swing shape to it than i had expected. but it is fitted enough at the top, that it still fit the bill. the pink is woven with a taupey color, and the effect is great. almost a little retro.",0
24,49,Not for me...,"I'm surprised to be unhappy with this... reading all the rave reviews. but, i had a different experience with it. the cut is funky... and seemed much more tapered on me than on the model in the picture. i think if you're very slim, this may work well, but for any curves or hips... not so flattering... imo. i think it's a pretty jacket... but not for me... it's going back. and ps... i paid $448 for it and see it's on sale for about 1/2 that just a week later. the discounted price may be a good de",3
24,49,"Scrumptious, cozy, beautiful sweater","I purchased this on sale. it exceeded my expectations. it is extremely soft and had a very unique construction and details. i love it. it does shed a bit, but that does not bother me as the sweater is stunning! ordered my typical size small. no camisole is needed if worn with a nude bra.",0
24,49,Soooo soft!,This is a delightfully soft and fluffy sweater. i might have bought it if my store had the petite size. the white was pretty and a good weight (not too light or heavy) and comfortable. it would be fun to layer over various outfits. it did not seem to shed.,1
24,49,,"I usually wear a medium in jackets, took a chance with the small in this coat. it fits well, the arms are a bit snug but not too snug. beautiful design though. biggest disappointment was quality. i thought the jacket would be thick and warm. it's pretty thin, will test out warmth soon. overall decent purchase, would buy again.",0

24,50,Amazing sweatercoat!,"I gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester (poly/rayon blend) in it and i don't like polyester; still, i couldn't pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat. it's like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing! it's a little on the pricey side. since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat, i would have liked the price better if it was $100 less. it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on. i",17
24,50,Comfortable but boxy,"I purchased this sweater in camel and love it. the fabric is very soft and lightweight (perfect for warmer climates with chilly but not cold weather). i'm 5'9"" and got a medium, but the sleeves seemed a bit long to me. it's also a bit boxy due to double breasted the cut, so if you have a petite frame it may overwhelm you. otherwise it's definitely a great coat for the money.",2
24,50,Love love love how long this sweater is,"I was already purchasing another mock neck in a similar color when i came upon this sweater. it is everything a snuggly sweater should be. it is long in the torso with long sleeves that really do cover your hands, like in the picture online. if you like that sort of thing, this is a great sweater. the sweater even has pockets, which may be a little odd, but on this sweater it works. i bought this to wear with a pair of sanctuary flowered leggings. it is the perfect outfit!",12
24,50,Lovely jacket,"The collar on this jacket is amazing; there is so much you can do with it to create different styles and looks. it gives it a glamorous edge with a classic uniqueness. the print contains vibrant colors - perfect for holiday parties as well as for work and other occasions. when you snap it, the material gets bunchy and awkward-fitting so it's best to wear it as a wrap. it is a little pricey in my opinion and i am guessing it is due to the perfect and flawless design that stands apart from some of",15

24,54,,"When i saw this item online, i ordered it right away. loved the color and the oversized, comfy look to it. the pros: very soft,the color a deep cranberry as pictured. the cons; the low back - in the photo, the model's arms cover it up. when i put it on, it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front -- and because the material is unstructured, that made it look worse. i loved it except for this one feature, but because it was so detracting, i had",2

24,72,"Boxy, navy color looks darker than pictured","I tried this sweater on in the store. i love the design and was hoping it would look as good on me as it does on the model. first off i should point out that the navy color in the featured photo looks much lighter than the sweater does in person. some of the photos accurately represent how dark the blue is (it almost looks black) but the featured photo shows it more like a medium navy. secondly, anyone looking to purchase should know it is very warm. if you are buying to wear mostly indoors you",15

24,75,Perfect versatile sweater,,2
24,77,Perfect for fall,"I saw this in my local store last night and was instantly drawn to the color. it is more greenish than yellow. i say this alot but this was so much prettier in person. i would not look twice at it online- the picture does it no justice. i am not a pancho person, but this looks very luxurious and expensive and it feels so soft and warm. i tried the xs/s and it fit perfect - i am typically a medium in other brands at antrho. it is boxy, but that is the point of a sweater of this type. it will be p",1
24,78,"Stylish, comfortable and affordable!!!!",Love this sweater. i have it in cream and ordering navy. it is comfortable and looks great with pants or a skirt. i do not like my sweaters tight so i have a large and love the fit. i am 5' 4'' and weigh 135 and usually buy medium to large.,2

24,83,,"I love this tunic. the knit is soft and comfortable and very easy to wear. i purchased ""moss"" and can change the look of the outfit by adding various accessories. the slits on the side are cut rather high and i have found that jeans or leggings of a thicker fabric look best.",0
25,20,Perfect for almost any weather,"I love this top. i bought it in the blue but loved all the colors. i fell in love with it on-line and hesitated ordering it only because i was afraid that the arm holes would be too large (based on what i saw in the picture). fortunately they had it at my local retailer, so i was able to try it on. my usual xs fit perfectly. great flow, soft and casual. perfect for those cool nights in the summer or layered with a cardigan in the winter.",0
25,21,,I just want you guys to be aware that the red print is not short sleeved! we have this in store and both are 3/4 length sleeves! great material and fit.,28
25,22,Perfect!,This is such a perfect tee to wear on cold days! it's a fall/winter/spring staple for sure. it's very soft and falls perfectly. i would definitely recommend it.,2
25,25,Fancy tank,The material is so soft and the design makes it a little more fancy so you can dress this tank up or down. its definitely an instant favorite. and the color blue is a beautiful rich blue,0
25,26,Great top!,This top is great. it hangs in the perfect way to hide imperfections. the orange/red is a great accent and i received compliments when i wore it.,0
25,26,So much better in person!!!,"I have four kids and a post baby bump that wants to live on forever, so i'm a huge fan of flowy tops--this one looked cute online, but i wasn't sold on it and passed. then i went to the store the next day and saw it, and the colors were more vibrant, so i thought, why not try it on, though i wasn't that excited about it. i tried it on and it was like the shirt was having her cinderalla moment--totally transformed how it looked on me and in person. i love it! it was one of those instant ""i'm buyi",0
25,26,,"Really wanted to love this top but it was too boxy for me! really pretty deep wine colors and a great plaid, but overall it did not give me any shape and it was returned,",0
25,29,Tighter than expected,"I ordered this in green when it was on sale and was so excited to get it. i thought the color would compliment my complexion perfectly. i read the other reviews who mentioned this item fit closer to the body than what is shown on the model - i wish i would have listened. while it is a very comfortable piece and stretches, it is a lot tighter than i wanted and because of that it is a bit see through. i didn't want to have to wear a cami underneath and i am pretty curvy. this top does show many of",0
25,30,Different and flattering,Purchased this shirt for holiday photos and it worked great. very flattering and a fun take on plaid. more feminine than your classic plaid button down.,1
25,32,Cute but a little maternity looking,"I'm keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3"" casual heel. i'm short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you?",0
25,32,Tee shirt material... blowsy,"I didn't realize the patterned material was tee shirt material. i got lots of compliments on it though. i'ts blowsey from the bust down (i got the short sleeved red one) but it's comfortable without looking sloppy. if you can pull off the tucked in look, it's super cute.",0
25,33,Sleeves too tight,"Ordered a l and xl, the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned.",12
25,34,Fun take on plaid,"I was looking for a red and black plaid top with a twist, and this tee definitely fits the bill! i plan to wear this shirt with a long sleeve tee under it for extra warmth for casual holiday events, and can see it with a skirt and cardi for work. fabric is soft and comfortable. fit is loose but not too boxy.",0
25,34,Great casual top,This might be one of my new go to tops. looks cute with jeans and a sweater or alone. the arms are snug but not uncomfortable and i think it adds to the shirt.,0
25,34,Unimpressed,This top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering. i would not recommend.,2
25,34,Versatile great top,"I've worn this top with leggings and straight leg jeans. looks great with both. it's almost like a t shirt but not as clingy and way more style. i'm 5'3, 165 and the large fit great. it hid my leftover baby belly and still looked stylish with flats or boots. only complaintbis that the armholes are cut low, so side of my bra is visible. but overall it's well worth it!",0
25,35,So cute. too small.,"So wanted to love this top. love the look entirely. but the medium was beyond snug, so i sent it back for a large. hopefully the bigger size will make it a keeper!",0
25,35,Would have been a great look...,"But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves, but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.",18
25,36,Cool and casual,"This top is a nice piece to transition into fall. it goes well with jeans, but it could also be dressed up with black pants.",2
25,36,Fun top!,"I ordered the orange motif in short sleeves.and i got what i ordered- and love it. it is a little big, but i wanted a looser top. i was looking for something bright and fun for the spring time that i could wear to work with nice slacks or dress down with jeans. this top meets my needs for sure. i really like the detailing on the top collar-bone area. my husband loved that it was bright and cheerful- so i take this as a win!",1
25,36,Great top!,"This top is very comfortable and really cute on. the material is super soft. i bought the white and am very happy with it, but it is a little sheer so i have to wear a cami with it. i would definitely recommend!",15

25,37,,"Love this! i am 5' 118 and the medium fits like a dress, not a tunic. i opted for the medium because i didn't want the fit to be tight. it is thin so you'll need a slip.",6
25,38,Flows nicely,"I love this shirt. i'm 5' 4"", 110lbs, just had 3rd baby so not into tight fighting clothes at the moment. love the loose yet flattering fit of this shirt. the sleeves are not too tight on me and i love the length.",1
25,38,Happy with the look and fit,"I love the built in layers of this shirt. it looks great layered with a long sleeved shirt underneath for winter also. being a teen in the 90s, it reminds me of a little bit of grunge, but in a less brooding more classy way. if only i still had my doc martins... i find the fit to be great, slightly loose, but not baggy and the fabric feels light but not fragile.",0
25,39,Not as described,"I did not like the fit of this. as another reviewer stated, it is not a swing tunic. it hangs fairly straight. i don't have large hips. i'm 5'8"" and 120 lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering. i returned it immediately.",0
25,39,"Really cute shirt, but don't upsize","Love this shirt. the print is a little loud, but cute. i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy. however, that was a mistake with this shirt. there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size. i did like it enough to order again in the correct size (l). i am a size 14 and busty, if that helps. the red is short-sleeved, by the way if ordered online, cute and flattering.",10
25,39,This top runs both small and true to size,"This top has a lot of potential (comfortable, easy to wear) but it's cut too small in the area above the bust. i tried the top in small, medium and large (i usually wear s or m in retailer tops) and couldn't get that area to not look tight or like it was pulling. you can see it on the model, too -- that space right above the bra near the armhole. i think you'd need to order a size up to get that space to work but then the top will start to look too big on the bottom. 
i tried the green in the sto",12
25,40,I bought both colors,"It's a light material so it flows. the shine is just enough to dress up when i need. i'm a 12 and usually buy xl of any t-shirt looking style, but the large fit perfectly. i am however not large breasted.",10
25,41,"My best retailer purchase, ever","36dd, size 10/12 top and 12/14 bottom

these tank tops are literally the best thing i have ever purchased from retailer. the colors and patterns are gorgeous - i have four of these (yellow, green, navy birds and the white with navy flower)! the top layer and middle liner are heavy, high quality polyester. the bottom layer is a comfortable knit. the extra layers make this top warmer than most tanks - it's perfect for layering under a sweater or jacket. it's very loose and flowy. i could have",0
25,42,Love the silhouette...but the shirt is see through,"This shirt had everything going for it - the cut, the length, the fun texture, but when i stepped into the light it was totally see through. i don't want to have to wear another shirt underneath. this one is going back. definitely not a swing, but still cute.",7
25,44,,"Description is wrong. not a swing tunic. more long and straight. keep that in mind when buying this. if you have hips, this might not be the top for you",27
25,45,Nothing like the picture!,"I thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt. not at all! i'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight. it is more fitted. if you are looking for something more comfy, don't buy. however, if you want more of a fitted blouse feel, then go for it.",0
25,46,Cute and versatile!,"I tried the red version at store, it fit really good and i loved it. then i found the blue version online and liked even more. it can be worn for business and casual.",0
25,54,Not as expected,"The material was thin, showed every lump you'd rather hide and clung to the body. even the sleeves were tight. looked inexpensive.",13
25,59,Soft & pretty,Bought the blue/gray - love the color. just the right amount of cling. adorable alone or under cardigan. super deal on sale.,0
26,20,Great print,"I'm 5'5"" 120 lbs and i bought these in a 0. they fit great. i wore them for upwards of 12 hours and i was very comfortable. i received compliments on the print and cut. very flattering.",0
26,25,Not quite perfect,"I really love the look of this jumpsuit, casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and, similar to another reviewer, proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture, but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows, and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.",1
26,30,Not for me,I really liked this jumpsuit but it just wasn't perfect. the design at the top is a bit stiff compared to the rest of the jumpsuit. i felt the whole thing ran just slightly too large. it was nice - but not amazing.,0
26,33,Love it,I got this at the sale price and it fits great. the bottom was wrinkled so it was not as open at the end like the picture but i am sure an iron will help.,0
26,34,Great pants; run large,,4
26,35,Flowy & fun,This jumpsuit is great. i recently had a baby and am still trying to get the last 10 lbs of baby weight off and this jumpsuit is very forgiving and super comfortable. i'm usually a medium & i wasn't sure if i should size up. i ordered the medium and it was the right choice. great light material for summer and nice neckline.,11
26,38,Best for tall folks,"This jumpsuit is lovely and comfortable, with gorgeous embroidered detailing, but it really needs to come in petite sizes. at 5'4"" with a pretty proportional torso to leg ratio, i found the hem length okay but the top portion way too long. for the waistband to be anywhere near my natural waist, the shoulders would have had to be taken up several inches and the armholes shortened.",5
26,38,Soooooo comfortable,"I love jumpsuits but this literally feels like pajamas. it doesn't look like pajamas but it is soft and cozy and isn't too big or too tight anywhere. i am 5'6"" and 130 and i purchased the small and it fits just like the model. the button in the back at the top is a little hard to close but the whole thing comes off and on easy which is such a bonus in a jumpsuit. this is a winner! it can be worn casually or dressed up.",0
26,39,"Fun and different,","These pants have substance in the material, it seems thick. i found htem to be very comfortable and love the tir waist detail. my only ""complaint' is they don't come in petites, so on my short legs, teh hem came jsut above my ankle. i think htey would look nicer with a tighter shirt than pictured on the model. did not purchase,but keeping in mind for future...",0
26,42,"True red, true beauty.","These pants are gorgeous--the fabric has a satiny stretch that simply feels decadent on. i tried on the size 0 and 2 and though they both fit, the size 2 was more flattering (i'm 5' 8"" 120lbs). compared to cartonnier's capris (which i love and wear a size 4 in), the fabric and construction on these is superior. and the color is knockout red.",0

26,53,"Fits nice, cute","I'm 5'8, 130 and ordered a small. it fits very nice and it's flattering. my daughter doesn't like it as she thinks it looks like a t-shirt tucked into pants. i get that but it fits nicely and i like the pattern and tapered legs.",1
26,53,Material was light and comfortable,I loved the jumpsuit but unfortunately had to return it due to running a little on the small size.,1
26,56,Can't wait to wear this!,"You know how sometimes you put something on and don't even have to look in the mirror to know you like it? well this is that piece of clothing. i bought a jumpsuit last year at retailer and wore it all the time so i wanted to get a new one this year. i saw this on the website and liked it all the way through when i put it on at the store. comfy, casual, not too young for my 56-year-old self, the right length, and i can comfortably wear a regular bra with it. perfect on all counts.",0
26,57,Versitile!,"I was not sure if they would be flattering with the waistband, but i love them. they feel wonderful, yet they are so light. perfect for warm weather. the print takes them from day to night.",1
26,58,Great romper but not for all body types!!,"Tried this romper on in store and wanted to love it but it just didn't fit me right. it'a great romper, cute design, super soft-light fabric and overall a great feel but it doesn't work to well for short girls with any types of hips. i have a very small waist and larger bottom and this romper just was very unflattering. i couldn't get the tie waist to sit anywhere that felt like my natural waist, instead it kept giving me a kangaroo pouch and hung on my upper thighs. sizing up didn't help becaus",4
26,65,Fabulous fit!!,"If you've been searching for red crops, gotta give these a try!! i bought my normal size 6 and they fit perfectly! they're a little more snug on me in the butt and thigh than on the model, but they're super flattering and the color is wonderful!! fabric is a tad thin, really stretchy (in a good way), and the weight is great for summer. i haven't worn them yet, so i'm not sure if they'll keep they're shape. fingers crossed!",1
26,67,Great pant,"I love this pant. it is so soft and has some stretch in it. the first pair i tried in a size 10 and the sales associate suggested trying a size 12 as ithis pant should not fit tight as it is a trouser. tie 12 is perfect. it reminds me of a ""retro"" pant,which i love.",1
26,67,My view on sizing,"Based on other reviews, i ordered these trousers in my regular size 8 (dark grey) and up one size10 (black motif). the size 8 fit perfectly; and the size 10 are too big (returning). i am not sure what the other reviewers experienced, but size 8 in this brand fits, regardless of style. i also prefer the solid grey, but that is just a personal choice. i felt the black motif trousers looked like pajama bottoms.",0

so cozy!",1

27,33,Cool sweater vest,"Great sweater vest. its not too thin or too thick, just right for fall or winter when its time to start layering. the material is a nice soft knit and the zipper on the back is a great addition. its easy to put on and i don't worry about the zipper snagging the material and causing any damage. i plan on pairing it with a polka dot long sleeve shirt that i have and it looks great. i am looking forward to wearing this when the weather becomes cooler. highly recommend. i am a 36b and usually wear a",0

27,35,Rare stylish sweater,"I liked the look of this online, but it's even nicer in person. just the right length on the hips, a medium weight, and with enough interest and exposure on the shoulders to make it feel like a stylish option for a slightly cool night without falling into the too-heavy and makes-you-feel-dumpy category of sweater. like the slightly short sleeves too.",1
27,35,,"I ordered the white in this. i found it to be so much prettier in person than the photos. i don't think they do this piece justice. i am normally a medium and that is what i ordered. i found it fit true to size. love the three ties in the back. it's a tad baggy, but looks great. i can see that this might snag easily though.",1

27,38,"Interesting sweater, good quality","I'm an xl but ended up buying this in a size large. i am very pleased with the interesting cable pattern that runs down the front. i also really like that this is cotton, and even though it is heavy and substantial, the thread gauge is a fine weight. while this says i can hand wash the sweater, i'm reluctant to because i'm worried that hand washing will end up stretching the sweater out of shape. i don't care for the heavy gold zipper running down from the neck, but my hair hides that. overall,",6
27,38,Sweater love!,This has instantaneously become my favorite sweater in my closet. the fit is great- a little oversized which makes it very cozy. i purchased my usual size xs. the shade of red is perfection. i wished it was a tad bit softer but would buy again and again!,10

27,40,Not as great as the photos,"I love mixed media clothing, and this is no exception. i fell in love with this right away, and after being torn between the two colors, opted for the rose. it's very gorgeous in person - midweight and very soft. however, as soon as i put it on, i noticed the knit sides truly flare out; they don't lay nicely like on the model. it could be because of my large chest (36dddd), but everything below the chest seems to widen me. it might work better on someone with a straighter build or smaller chest.",2
27,42,Beautiful!,"I got the purple color and absolutely love it. i am 5'2"" but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer. i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm. it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely!",0
27,42,Wanted to love,"This would have been a perfect jacket for a trip i'm taking, light weight and very stylish. however the jacket runs huge, the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big. i wear a size 8-10 mostly 10 in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about 2? past my natural shoulders. i won't return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool (i should have checked) its unbearably itchy esp around the neck, you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it",17

27,53,Odd fit,"I love the idea of this top.  i had reservations when i ordered it d/t the large armholes but i envisioned wearing my cute cropped pilcro jean jacket with it.  it turned out to be a disappointment.  the armholes are gigantic and the sweater itself did not fit as on the model.  the front was much shorter and wider and basically stuck out from my body.  for reference, i ordered the xxsp.  sizing up might have lengthened the front but would have exacerbated the armhole problem.",0
27,55,Love this sweater!!!!!,"Omg i love this sweater. it is minimalistic yet romantic. my mother in-law bought this for me last may when she was visiting and one for herself. i saw it today at the store in white and i snatched it up. i will wear this for years. i did not see until now that is is meant to be worn with the ties in the back. i've been wearing it with the ties in the front. what a bonus that there are 2 ways to wear this wonderful sweater. i will wear these 2 pieces for many, many years.",8
27,55,Versatile; size down,"Much nicer in person -- the chunky knit reads more gray with black accents than ""blue"" as described here. there are lovely flecks of rust, blue, goldenrod, green throughout. super soft, stretchy; it's fine sizing down...otherwise the arm holes dip down very low. i'm usually a size 4/small and xs was best for me (33"" bust, long torso, broad shoulders). i can see wearing another layer underneath when cold weather sets in.",0

very well made with a relaxed yet feminine fit.
the cobalt blue accents are not as vivid as they appear online, was slightly disappointed with that, but being more subtle will make it more wearable...so no ""oh she is wearing that jacket again""....
the forest green is rich and elegant.
the fit is true to size, but this is not a fitted jacket, it falls more straight, but the peplum is a gorgeous accent. 
a classic with impeccable quality!",0

31,43,Very comfortable denim,"These are great jeans and worth every penny. they hug every curve and have just enough give in the places that you need them. i find them to be very figure-flattering and dressed them up with high heeled boots and a nice blouse. even though i'm petite, i ordered a regular in my size (26) because i wanted the length of regular jeans as opposed to ankle length.",3
31,44,Great crop staple,"Love the pilcro brand! size down!! super soft, well fitting, great length. great darker color for fall. awesome rise. not too high, not too low. will be grabbing these a ton this fall.",0
31,44,Unique wash,These jeans are soooo soft. fit is great and the wash is a unique inky grayish color. perfect for fall. love.,3
31,45,Always love my pilcro jeans,"I am consistently a size 27 in pilcro jeans and these are no exception. these are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am 5'3"" but i still love them. i found them to be true to size. because they don't have much stretch, they are a little snug in the thigh at first but the denim gives a bit throughout the day. the shorter length with the little flare is so versatile - they look great with a dressy top and heels and just as good with a cozy sweater and flat chelsea boots. love pilcro!!!",0
31,45,"My new ""go-to"" jeans","Just got these jeans last week. love the quality, which is typical of pilcro jeans. i usually have to get a tall size, being 5'10"", however they sold out quickly. so i decided to order the regular inseam in my usual size. they fit great. since they are more of a boyfriend jean, they don't fit too snug. so i'm able to get away with the regular inseam. i'm usually a 26-27 tall, and the 27 regular works. love the cuffs and rise in the jeans. i've worn with booties, heels...and am waiting for warm w",2
31,45,,"Love these pants! super comfy and casual. i found they run true to size and are just lose enough to feel casual, not sloppy. my only complaint, the cuffs of the jeans were thoroughly covered in some kind of animal hair! very disgusting. but love the jeans.",1
31,46,Great fall jeans!,,1
31,46,,As another reviewer mentioned the quality isn't here.  they pilled in the thighs after wearing once and stretched out so much at the end of the day i was pulling them up constantly.  such a bummer because i love this brand.,0
31,47,Disappointed,"Although i bought 2 sizes down from my regular size, they were still big and, made my derriere look flat. i would have kept them as weekend kick-around jeans, but the flat behind just made them a must return.",0
31,47,Funky fun flares,"I saw these in the sale section on line and just loved their look. they fit great and have a cute little flare at the bottom. i like the reinforced inside seams which means they will last longer. i've been wearing them with my shorter boots and booties this winter. i have slim legs and they aren't too tight and not too loose. my inseam is a 33 so they may be a tad short on me, but i love them.",0

31,54,,"Love these pants. i have several pairs of the pilcro scrip (and formerly super script). these do not have quite as much elastic as some cuts, but they still fit well and look great.",0
31,55,Finally found a perfect pair of jeans,"I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material, yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7, 130 pounds, athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans.",27
31,56,Very comfortable,"These jeans are so comfortable and do not stretch out enough to size down, in my opinion. right when i put them on i could tell they fit perfectly. i have been buying pilcros for several years and have not been happy with the stet ankle jeans from the last 2 yrs because although they were very flattering when you first put them on, they stretched out so much it was annoying. 
these script jeans are amazing, flattering and are a nice lightweight denim. i wore them a few times before washing and",1
31,57,Great fit. i need to fix cuffs.,"Great fit in waist, hips and butt. i wore them all day and they did not stretch out.

i am tall but the length of the jeans with the cuff is a tiny bit past my ankle bone. i want it just above the ankle bone so i am re-doing the cuff slightly and then i must send these to my tailor to close the cuff completely. they look silly when the big cuff isn't at least tacked in place. perhaps by design they were left this way so each of us buyers could find the proper length and close the cuff ourselves.",2
31,58,Best jeans ever!,I was so lucky to find these jeans in store yesterday and they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever had. the fit is amazing and wish they weren't sold out online or i would buy more!,0
31,59,,"Perfect jean. these jeans are comfortable, the length is great, and the rise, at least for me, is spot on. my torso is fairly straight - not a lot of the hourglass thing going on - and somehow these jeans feel like they were made for me. thank you pilcro.",0

31,64,Just love...,"Ordered my usual size 28 in pilcro jeans but these are on the small side. fit is a little small in the waist area, & don't mean to be crude but the crotch area is on the short side for me. legs fit snug, & i have skinny legs! i'll have size up to a 29. the twisted seam look is really cute. 5'3"" abt 118# - too much ice cream lately.",18
31,64,They are tapered! why?!,"Waist is tight and thighs and legs are not. -not flattering- ankle opening is too small, and they have a funny smell.",2

32,27,Adorable everyday look!,"This blouse is great to wear almost anytime! it can easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion and the accessories. it has a bit more volume around the waist then the picture shows - but that could be because i'm bit more ""well endowed"" than the model. i'm 5'0 and size m/8. this shape looks great on my curves without making me look chunky or stout. the image makes the color look black, but in person the color can pass for a really dark blue in some light. the textile of the fabric is",0

32,46,So beautiful,"I wanted to give this top some love. i ordered this top and the kota peasant top with plans to only keep one of them. this top is definitely the winner. the neckline, sleeves, pattern, fabric, and length are gorgeous and flattering. it is very feminine and elegant and i think it will also be versatile....it could be very dressy (depending on what you wear it with) but it will also look great with jeans and shorts and sandals. it is a bit sheer so a tank or cami might be needed underneath. i orde",6
32,50,Beautiful top!,This top looks even better in person! the green is a little brighter than the photo. this beautiful blouse is silk with a sold underlining. it is very full and has great flow and movement. super trendy with the open shoulders and a nice long sleeve for fall. it's really beautiful and perfect for any festive occasion!!,7
32,50,Runs very large,"My review of the pros : 1) quality made, not see through in any way, can wear with small bra straps 2) lace gives the top a 'different look"", really liked it. my review of the cons, which made me return the top 1) runs huge!!! i am 5'2"", 36 small c, broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl. it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered' at the armpits? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs, which i never wear in any size top. 2) for petite gals (i am 5'2""), this a a",2
32,51,Not as pictured,"Really wanted to like this top. the model has it on backwards - the ""v"" is actually the back and closes with an eye hook (that is where the tag is ? there's also a seam running down the back). the front is actually a high round neck. the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap. i'm usually a s or xs. in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely. the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up.",0
32,62,Gorgeous,The most beautiful top in my closet and i have a huge closet of beautiful clothes! hope retailer carries more peasant top by this brand...stunning,0
32,66,Not for the well endowed,"I ordered the medium, my usual size for flowing tops. it fits nicely, looks amazing from the front and looks slimming. then i turned to the side and oh my...my boobs protruded like two big balloons. i looked like wonder woman. there was plenty of fabric and it was billowy so it wasn't the size just the cut. i do have 34 g's but what the heck? the color is glorious but it has to go back.",1
33,25,Great fitting for women with curves,I have had a hard time finding shorts as i have a smaller waist and bigger thighs. i am 5 ft 4 and weigh 125 lbs and i wear a size 25/26 in jeans i bought a size 26 in these and they fit great. i wouldn't size down if you have thighs as i like some room in mine.,8
33,28,"Comfy, summery",I bought these in a few different colors because they are so comfortable and perfect for summer. they fit true to size if you want a more relaxed fit. i sized down for one pair for a more fitted look.,0
33,28,Love and disappointment!,"These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly, using free and clear detergent on a cold, delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy, and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair, but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go, but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!",0
33,32,Perfect,"These have an amazing fit! i have them in three colors. they are not too low rise, they are not too high. they are the perfect length. the only thing i do not like is the rolled cuff is not stitched and comes down easily if you do not iron down.",0
33,33,Great shorts,"Very happy with the fit, sizing, and look of these shorts.",0
33,34,Love pilcro!,"First let me say that i've recently fallen in love with the pilcro brand. i love the pilcro hyphen chinos and needed some new shorts for the summer. i have extremely muscular legs and have a hard time finding shorts that look good. i was hesitant to try these on because they said the inseam is 4"" but one other reviewer pointed out that they are a good mid-length if you unroll them, so i just went to try them on at the store, and what do you know? they are exactly that! unrolled, they come about",0
33,37,Different colors are sized differently,"I tried these shorts on in 5 colors and found a wide variety of sizing. in the dark grey and taupe i needed to size down one from my usual 28 to a size 27. in the sapphire, lavender and red my regular size 28 fit perfectly. i ended up purchasing the dark grey and lavender with a discount. i gave 4 stars for the variation in sizing but once i got the correct fit the shorts have not stretched out on me throughout the day in either color. the length is perfect, short enough to not look frumpy, but",14
33,38,Just what i needed in a summer short,"I was running low on good summer shorts and thought i'd try these based on having a pair of the pilcro cropped pants i got a couple months ago. i tried these shorts on in-store to make sure they fit right and that i liked how they looked but then bought them online (more colors were available in my size than what they had in store). i bought these in 3 different colors and i absolutely love them all! they are my go-to shorts now, they look good with the legs rolled up or down, and i will be wear",0

33,41,Love these but color faded when washed,"I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy, untreatable stains). unfortunately, the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back",1
33,42,Wow,"I absolutely love these shorts! i wear a 28 in all pilcro and these are no exception. i would not have grabbed these to try on, but the person who put my clothes in a fitting room added them for me. first, they are definitely short when rolled twice, and i do not have skinny legs. in fact, i never wear anything that exposes my thighs because i really dislike them. for some reason, these shorts make my legs look great! i thought for sure it was the mirrors at retailer, but i still like them at home",0
33,42,,"I ordered these in white and sized down from my normal 28 to 27 based on reviews and they are too small. i've seen with other pants/shorts that sizing can be off with different colors, so i'm guessing it's the same case here. i'll try ordering again in my usual 28 and hope that they will be a good fit. otherwise, nice shorts for the price.",1
33,43,Favorite shorts ever,If i could get these in every color i would! these shorts fit so well and the quality is really nice. i wear them with t-shirts or dress them up with a blouse. i'm a mom in my mid-40's and its hard to find a decent pair of shorts that fit me without being too long or too short - these fit the bill.,0

34,37,,"Love this skirt. purchased it in a 0 and it fit fairly good. sat high up on the waist, which i like. however, now that i have worn it i should have ordered it in a 2. i think the 2 would have let it sit further down making it not so short. i do recommend this skirt but i would order both your regular size and one size up (0 is my typical size in full skirts).",5

34,42,Could have been perfect...,"I am 5'8"", 140lbs, pear-shaped. i ordered the s and it fit perfectly, just skimming the floor. the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet-inspired colors. the waistband is elasticized but not elastic, and there is no unflattering poofing, which can happen with skirts like this. the flaw, however, is in the decision to only half-line this skirt with an off-white jersey material. the half-lining isn't horrible but i found it",2
34,42,Great transition to fall,"I really like this skirt. it is soft and the length is just right. i hate skirts that go below the knee. the only thing i don't care for is that there seems to be extra fabric in the back... maybe i should had ordered a size down. and the skirt does wrinkle easily. still, not enough reasons to send back. i have had many compliments at work.",0
34,42,Love it,This skirt is a perfect statement piece that will work fancy cocktails and social events. it is a full skirt but not too overwhelming. perfect with a slim fitting black bodysuit. i sized up a bit and ordered an 8. waist fits well and length works with slight heel. quality is great. design is beautiful without being too much.,0
34,44,Perfect addition to any wardrobe.,"I love this skirt. maybe i love wrap skirts in general, but many miss the mark. this one is just right. it does not have elastic waist band which always makes me look frumpy, instead it is a side zip and allows for the tummy to stay flat as well as the pleats. the embroidery is just enough and you may not be able to see the design of black on black in the fabric which makes the skirt. i usually wear a size 6 but the 8 fit just right, so you may want to size up.",2
34,44,Petite sizing?,This is a beautiful skirt. i wanted to make sure that i received a size that fit so i ordered two different sizes (pxs and ps). i typically wear a pxs but since the description mentions a side zip and it looked as if the skirt was to fit higher on the waist i thought i should also try a size up. as i mentioned it is lovely. light airy. i just wanted something easy to throw on and look put together with flat sandals and a tank for the hot weather that is coming and for an upcoming vacation to the,39

34,57,Mustard,"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40. i'm normally a size 10, but i took a 12 in this skirt.

2. it's comfortable and has pockets that you can really put your hands in.

3. sits at high waist. hem hits below the knee.

4. i didn't like the buttons. they are very round and stick out quite far. they are also mismatched. i would have liked them better if they were flatter.

5. i also didn't like the mustard color. it's unflattering to me.",8
34,61,Stunning,Colors are much more vibrant in person. love this skirt. true to size. makes a statement and is still classy.,0
34,62,Use as a top!,"I decided to go shopping at my local co store and as soon as i walked in, i saw this skirt but it was used  as a top with green cropped summery pants on a mannequin. one of the lovely salesgirls decided she liked it better that way after she tried it as a top herself.  i tried it as well and love it as a top! she was small framed and my height and told me she sized up for comfort and she was correct. if used with a strapless bra, your regular size ( mine is a small) will be uncomfortable. howeve",13
35,24,"All around a beautiful top, except for sizing","It's a cute top, but the only complaint i have is that it is difficult for me take off. it goes on easily, but i get always have a bit of a struggle trying to take it off. my shoulders tend to get stuck so i can't pull my arms out easily. i just wish the top had an extra button or two on the back or was made with material that allowed for some stretch without fear of destroying the lacework. i didn't want to size up another size because i have a petite body shape that would've been overwhelmed b",4
35,26,Gorgeous top,"I saw the cream top online and loved it, but it is even prettier in person. i typically purchase petite sizes online, but i tried on the 0 in the store and it fit nicely-- not super fitted throughout the waist as others have mentioned, but the length was just right and the arms/chest fit perfectly. for reference, i'm 5'2"", 100 lbs, 32b. this will look great with skinny pants or jeans.",3
35,26,High hopes,"I really wanted to love this. sadly, the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly, it's see through! a top like this looses it's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally, good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the ""poor man's pineapple top."" i couldn't agree more, sigh. i really did want",7
35,26,Like it but it is too loose,"I like this top. in the photo, the white in the print stands out. in-person, the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull, more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good, the print looks good. it is a swing top, looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down, could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.",6
35,29,Very cute,"I loved this top when i tried it on in the store. i was very close to buying, but i knew my sister would want, so i moved on. it is a great fitting top. i am 5'7, 125lbs, and the small fit perfectly. i do question how well this top will fit petite people.",1
35,29,Vintage looking top,"I bought this in a size 0 which is my usual retailer size. the lace is nice quality, not rough or scratchy. i purchased the ivory which does have some blush accents which make it look ""vintagey"". it will be perfect for the holidays or all fall/winter. i like that the peplum doesn't seem to flair out much. very pretty!",0
35,29,,This is nicer than the first reviewer states. the fabric feels very soft and the tunic does not look cheap.the top of the tunic was a little more fitted so it was a little tight for me since i have wide shoulders. i will have to get a larger size.,3
35,29,,"Very cute top. does require a strapless bra as the straps are further out than most tops, and they also tend to fall down. also, while the top fit well, the top button gaps are far apart and tended to separate to show my chest. easy fix with a snap sewed in.",0
35,30,Beautiful fabric,This shirt is really quite cute. it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. it's also forgiving and quite flattering. my only concern is that it is a bit see through in certain lighting but it is very subtle. i definitely would recommend.,0
35,30,Cute top,"I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said this top is better suited for someone tall and slender. the design on the lace is beautiful and i love the scalloped hem. but it is somewhat boxy and flowy, which didn't seem to work on my curvy body proportion-wise.",0
35,31,Elegant & fun,"Purchased this fun, feminine top right before vacation and wanted to wear it every single day. the peplum style isn't typically something i gravitate to, but this peplum is the perfect length and i love the sheer 3/4 length sleeves. i chose the ivory version of this top and it was adorable with jeans, oxfords & a cute hat. for how beautiful this top is, i feel like the price tag is an absolute steal!",1

35,33,"Great top, but not for a large bust","So many things to love about this top. if you're a fan of peplum tops - which i most definitely am - this is a great one. slightly shorter in front than in back. nice flare, but doesn't stick out too far. and overall, i thought it was well-made. i tried on the red in stores, and it looks a lot like the color in the photo. however, i'm a 36dd, and unfortunately, the top was just not large enough. totally squashed the girls, and there's basically no give in the fabric. i'm normally a 10/12, and ot",14
35,34,Better in person,"I was pleasantly surprised with the fit of this top! at 5' 6"", i'm rather busty, short waisted, and full-figured. i ordered my usual size 16, and the fit is a flattering, 'almost' empire silhouette. i was worried about the back being too long for my body shape, but it works great. the embroidery and construction make this a really special piece.",3

35,36,Love this shirt,"This is a gorgeous shirt. it actually looks more fitted on than in this picture, where it looks more shapeless. even though i love tunics, the online picture wasn't appealing to me -- but when i saw the shirt in store and tried it on i loved it. wore it to work today and loved it even more. it's great quality, gorgeous design, lovely tailoring and details throughout.",1

35,38,Beautiful blouse but too boxy/swingy,"The blouse is lovely - i loved the lace, color (though just as other reviewers mentioned its a darker blue closer to a teal color) and edging. i am very petite, for reference, 5'2"", 24 waist and 30e and normally wear a 00 or 00p. the 00 was still too wide for me around the waist/bottom and had too much of a swingy effect - it made me look like i was pregnant so i sadly returned. i wish this had more of a fitted look to it.",1
35,38,Obsessed!,"I fell in love with this in the store. i am petite at 5'3"" and 110 lbs and i went with the regular size 0. i agree with another reviewer that the petite sizing would have been too short. the color is rich, the quality is fabulous and i love the style. it is not fitted, but i also found that it wasn't too wide either. if you're looking for a fitted top, this wouldn't be the one. but if you love a well-styled top with a bit of volume that you can rock with a pair of skinnies to balance it out, the",1

35,39,Great top to span the seasons,"I think the orange top will look great in the fall as well as spring. i'm 5' 7.5"" and it's a great tunic length on me. it's really pretty and i love it. snap it up on sale!",0

35,39,Love it!!!,I love this more than my pineapple top. i am 128lbs and wear between a size 2-4 in tops got this in size 4 (same as the pineapple) and fits perfectly and comfotably. the color is white and has a lovely lace pattern. i would say it runs a litle on the small side. material is a bit more stiff than my pineapple top but i love the way it feels. in my opinion this is a staple top you can dress it up for a wedding or just going out its super lovely. they were so popular at the retailer near me tw,5

35,40,Versatile and unique,"I ordered this shirt with some trepidation after reading the one-star reviews. i was, however, pleasantly surprised when the shirt arrived and i put it on. i agree the sleeves are a bit on the slim side, noticeable mostly because the fabric doesn't have any give. the shirt fabric itself is both billowy and substantial and the embroidery work gives the shirt an expensive (because it is) and unique look. the shirt body is not as slim cut as it appears in the pictures; the darts open out to a much",0

35,42,Beautiful!,"I bought this blouse in both the cream and the blue. both are lovely. i would say that the size runs a bit large, i bought size 12 and the bodice hangs away from my back, arms fit well though, loose fit. hangs well. the lace is nice and stiff. the cream has some cafe au lait shading on some of the lace so it could almost look stained. i don't think that will be how it reads, though, but fair warning.",0
35,42,Unique piece / boho chic,"Love this blouse! i took a chance on ordering it and wasn't sure what i would think. this blouse is fabulous!!! it has a boho-chic flair to it in a sophisticated way. it's one of those ""special"" pieces from retailer; elegant, quirky, sophisticated.

35,43,Perfect lace top,"I absolutely adore this top! it is so versatile and looks equally beautiful with jeans as with dressier, skinny pants. i bought this to wear for our holiday photos and have gotten so much use out of it. worth every penny. i have just ordered the blue version and cannot wait to get it.",0

35,44,Totally sublime,"Lol on the previous comment about it being a poor man?s pineapple blouse. i think the pineapple blouse prints are too large on a petite person like me (i?m 5?2?), thus i prefer this blouse. i concur with the previous reviewer about getting makeup on the blouse due to the narrow collar. if you wear makeup like i do, you must find a trick to taking it on and off. for me, i put it on prior to putting on makeup (i even put tissue paper around the collar while putting on makeup, and don?t even think",6

35,46,Not for the big busted,"I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured, but because i have a larger chest, the peplum didn't hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer, which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it.",0

35,48,Very chic,"Absolutely love the diagonal zipper. it is extremely flattering for the office, and comfortable. a great layering piece with a simple blazer, or alone. looks high quality. my only one minor complaint is that the bottom tends to move away from my body, as the top is wide on the bottom. hence, gives you a lot of leeway in the stomach area. may not be a good thing, or may be a good thing. still, overall, a keeper.",0

35,49,Nice mix of romantic and practical,"I have a long list of criteria for this sort of a top. the lace can't be too fragile, the top can't be too see through, it can't bind my arms in an uncomfortable way and it can't be dry clean only. the stars have aligned on this one! i bought my usual size 2 and it fits tts. i only wish it was a little longer but i will probably wear it layered with a long cami. it certainly seems worth it for full price.",2
35,49,Shoulders are puffy,This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.,1

35,53,Got two colors!,"I ordered the navy, which is really stunning, by the way-and the cream. i asked my husband to choose the color for me and he asked me to keep both of them! there you have it. that should say it all! it is a beautifully done lace with an attached camisol liner which, if i'm not mistaken is on snaps so that you can remove it and wear your own cami if this one has a weird fit for you. the navy is really pretty due to the stark contrast of two shades of blue. as i said, my husband saw the cream colo",0

37,58,Perfect summer to fall,I bought this dress in burnt orange for my 19 year-old collage daughter. she loved it and has found many opportunities to wear it on campus. she said it is so comfortable and perfect with a sweater for cool fall mornings and sleeveless as the day warms up.,0

38,23,Not for the uber-curvy,"So much about this dress is wonderful - the fabric is a nice weight, the color is gorgeous (i got this in the blue), the length on the petite hits right above the knee. unfortunately, i got a 12p - my usual size in antho dresses - and the elastic waistband was on my boobs rather than under them. i've got a sizable bust (36g), so this happens from time to time. i'm exchanging for a regular, which hopefully will have a little more room, but busty gals beware! at least it's not too low cut!",1

38,26,Disappointing,"After reading the previous review, i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today, and i was so disappointed. first of all, it's huge. the medium was way too big on me, and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second, the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo, and the fabric felt cheap. finally, it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.",1

38,41,"Effortless, easy summer staple","This dress is gorgeous! the colors are deep and rich and the fabric is super soft. the top part is lined but still avoids feeling like it would be too hot when the temperatures warm up. bonus-- a regular bra works perfectly underneath without anything showing, even with the deep v neckline. while the waist does sit a bit high, it works perfectly on my body-- emphasizes the smallest part of my waist and then flows away. it drapes nicely, not too full and not too clingy. i am 5'7 and a true size 6",4
38,41,I really want to love this dress,"I'll start with what i loved, this dress is made with a really beautiful, quality material. the material is gorgeous in person and the dress is lined which is really nice. however the fit is just so very strange. i am 5'6"" and curvy. i tried both a medium and a small (for reference i usually take a medium or large/ size 8 or 10) the medium was so large and too roomy around the arms and chest (i'm 34 d) the small was too tight. the v neck lay in a very strange way and i'm not sure it would have b",25

38,42,Disappointed,I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store.,6

38,44,Not flattering unless you are tall and willowy,"I was on the fence about this dress because even on the model, it's a little bit frumpy, but it was so pretty that i tried it. however, on my short frame, it's even frumpier. the quality is very good, the fabric is soft and it's lined. the pattern is really pretty and delicate and i wish it was more flattering. i think the only way this dress will look good is if you are quite tall and thin. i am 5'4"", 110 lbs with large-ish hips and i ordered a 2p, but even the petite was too saggy. i needed a",2
38,44,Too baggy,"This dress is just too baggy overall. i am 5'6"" 140 lbs and a size small was so unflattering. i can't go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me. it was already a little high on the small.",0

38,48,Summery 20s dress,"I love the cut of this dress, and i'm rather short. i don't think you need to be tall. it's a nice, light fabric that will work well for warm weather. it did wrinkle quite a bit during the day, but never looked messy. i certainly wouldn't describe it as frumpy. it has a nice, loose, 1920s feel, and you can tighten the belt to make it more fitted through the waist. the belt is sewn on in the back, so you can't take it off without quite a bit of tailoring. i had no trouble with the bust being too",5

38,49,"Cute patterns, potato-sack fit","I found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute, but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style? it fits like a sack, big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem. it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape. genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style. to bad, i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time.",1
38,49,"Great, but...","Loved the dress. loved the pattern and the cut. unfortunately it did not work for me. it is cut too low under the arm pits and therefore, showed too much breast. it is not made to wear a bra with either so that is not a solution. sticky boobs will not work either because it is the ""side breast"" that shows. i hated to have to send back but.....still looking for something similar and great!",0

fyi: 36c (34d), short waist, broad shoulders/back, usually a 10/12 in a fitted top/dress

38,58,Disappointed,I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on--- thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering.,4

39,39,Sad but true,"I too will be returning this sweater. love the style, shape and fabric, but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap.",0
39,39,Soft and cute but shrunk :(,"I bought the pink one. i like this salmon pink color! not too girly type of pink.
the material is super soft and light. i have skinny torso, so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body...
the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash... it shrunk one size! when i bought it (size s), it covered my flat hips, fits just like the picture, but now my hips are showing :(
i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold & air dry.",0
39,41,Not so bad!,"I actually like this top, but i am wearing it as a cowl neck rather than off-the-shoulder. i found it at the store, so i didn't even know it was supposed to be that way. i have the ivory color, and it it does have some tan/beige specks in it, but i don't mind this at all, it adds some texture and warmth. i think it is a great neutral top for work. it has a double layer of fabric, so not sheer at all, and this keeps it smooth over my middle without a tank or cami.

39,44,Fall luxury,"Its a pleasure to wear this sweater! it feels like you are wearing a hug! it's that cozy! yet, it's almost weightless, which is nice for me because i get overheated easily. the only slight downfall is that it is dry clean only. i got this in charcoal but both color options are so pretty and you will be pleased how dressed up and flattering they look without giving up comfort!",1
39,46,Not what i hoped it to be!,"This top is very strange. i agree with the other reviewer in that i think it's not cotton. it clung and got bunched up around my chest. like in a static cling way. there's just something about the way it hangs that is not flattering. too bad as i was really looking forward to wearing this but alas, it's going back.",2
39,47,,I was looking for a top to go with leggings that didn't look like a sack and this is perfect. the v-neck and unusual cut on the bottom makes it more interesting than a typical tunic and the fabric is so snuggly. love it.,4

39,56,Fabric might not be cotton! stretched out!,"I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.

39,59,Pull over sweater,"Looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me. just for comparison, and i wish all reviewers would include this, i am 5'5"" and weigh 120 pounds. i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it. i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater. unfortunately i have returned it.",2
39,61,Perfect top,This top is so cute it's my go to top. dress up or down looks really cute with skinny skirt. i have the ivory and just ordered the dark grey. one great thing this top has pockets. i would buy this in many colors if i could. yes it's full but a cute full. but i love full tops. i think this is true to size it's not tight and i don't think it would be as cute tight. i actually like mine on me better than the one on the model.lol washes like a dream and you can dry it in the dryer.,0

colors are very neutral and warm. i like the addition of the inner layer to make this more wh",7
40,39,Layer cake,An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.,0
40,44,Grandma sleeves,Super cute sweater and i was totally excited and then i looked at the sleeves (which are not shown in the pictures). what you can not see are the dragonfly (sequins and sparkly beads suitable for women 4 and 84). ugh. too bad - going right back.,0
40,44,I agree with the whimsy,"Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo, you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not, it is terribly unflattering.",2

40,54,A mixed bag,"I loved the shape of this sweater. the way it draped from the waist was flattering and different. the sleeves were a strange length, however, between long and 3/4 length which made it look like they the sweater was just too short for me. the color looked peachy or pink in the photo, but in reality, it was almost skin tone, which was not flattering with my olive coloring. paler women might find it attractive. the real downside for me was the fabric which was thin with the flowers mainly printed o",0
40,56,Design is stamped on,"From the photos, i thought the design was embroidered. in reality, it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins, but overall, the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good, in fact it looked kind of cheap to me, so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.",0
40,56,Shapeless,"This cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined, but it is boxy and totally un-fitted. i swim, which means i have large shoulders, and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion, well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste-line. the sleeves are too long, and as usual, retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system, so if you choose to close this cardigan, it just looks awful.",1
40,56,,"This was on display when walked into my local retailer, it's just a beautiful in person. my mistake was trying it on, instant love! i tried on my usual size small & it fit perfectly. i would usually wait for something in this price range to go on sale, but i just had to have this. worth the splurge!",3

40,62,Timeless and unique,"As stated by others, this is the type of unique retailer product that i love and that makes me return to the store again and again. i would have given it 5 stars if the sleeves were lined and the body length was longer. the sleeves are indeed long, although this adds to the coziness. but i would have loved the body a bit longer like other cardigans have been. i'm looking forward to wearing it as soon as we get a bit more cool here. congratulations, retailer, for a winner!",3

42,31,Worn often and loved every time,Starts out crisp but not too tight. doesn't over-stretch through the course of the day. very comfortable but looks polished. front pockets sewn together like all verdugo jeans: good particularly because it eliminates the awkward brighter white where actual pockets would show through fabric on other white jeans. washes exceptionally well and holds its shape as well as softness; which is good because being white they pick up stains easily. be careful with underwear lines- thong probably best.,2

42,57,Classy,"These jeans are buttery soft and very flattering. unlike many jeans these do not ride down my waist as i wear them. i am a bit concerned about them long term as they list rayon as the primary fabric, which means they have to be washed very carefully. still, i highly recommend.",1

42,67,Adorable easy to wear,"I saw this online and then at the retailer store where i was able to try it on and was happily surprised.yes it is way oversized but if you size down it will work best. i have narrow hips and shoulders but a 34 dd bust, so fit is not always easy. because of my shape i normally wear a medium or small but had to size down to an xs petite in this. you may find, as i did, that it works dressed up or down. if i had bought a regular size, and were lots younger, it could have worked for a dress with tigh",1

43,47,So flipping soft and pretty!,This is really cute - it has a boxy look and bell-like sleeves. the knit is chunky and so very soft. i didn't want to take it off. i purchased an xs in black. it's gorgeous. my beige bra shows through so i will need to wear black or a camp underneath. it feels really heavy - in a good way - and it feels like it will be really warm. the black has a velvety look to it. i'm smitten. i should also mention that it did feel cropped to me - i know i read other reviews that said it wasn't cropped. i fee,1

44,50,Definitely a summer dress,This dress is tricky. the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small. i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath. the fabric is a very thin linen. my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro. its very light and cool perfect for the summer time.,2
44,50,Interesting piece,I couldn't believe how fast this dress sold out when they were having the fall promotion; they had just put it on the website and it sold out in my size in a matter of hours!  i just received the dress today and really like the practicality of it.  you can easily dress it up or down and it still looks sheek either way.  what i didn't like about the dress was that the material is a little flimsy compared to how it looks in the picture.  i am on the fence regarding if i will keep it.,0

first off, the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo. secondly, there is no shape whatsoever, unlike in the photo. it bells out like a tent. it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not. overall, this shirt is an insult to the female form.

47,33,In love with this dress,I am in love with this dress. ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 (i go back and forth) and this time i kept the six. there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe. i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it's appropriate for work and for an evening out.,1
47,34,Cute and unusual,"I found this tts (ordered a m, i'm an 8) and not annoying to put on. i ended up being glad it doesn't have a zipper - when i tried it on, i thought it would look better with a v-neck, so i tried it on backwards with the hook and eye open in the front. i think it's identical back and front except for that, and it looks cuter with a slightly lower neckline, especially for a bustier person like me. i might sew down the flaps on the inside of the neck so it makes a somewhat high v-neck. with that al",7

(5'7,"" 140 lbs., 32d) ended up with with a medium. 100% cotton so i won't be machine drying this cuz it looks prone to shrinkage. too casual to wear to work but it'll be fun to run errands, etc. in this for at le",3

49,46,Not for large chests,"This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.

49,46,Test like fit,"This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops, and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering, falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately",0

49,47,Love it! i wish they had it in more colors,"I noticed that someone wrote a review about how after washing her shirt, she hated it.  well, i have washed mine 2 or 3 times already and have never ironed it.  i do use fabric softener, and i take it out and hang it to dry after it has tossed in the dryer for about 5 minutes.  it is not meant to be a crisp dress shirt, but a soft casual shirt, and as i said before, i have not ironed it once.  it looks like it did when i bought it, even straight out of the dryer.

49,47,New favorite top,The shoulder bearing aspect makes this top sexy yet it doesn't look like you're trying too hard. sleeves can be worn up or down and everything stayed in place either way. i get tons of compliments each time i wear this.,3
49,48,Thin lightweight and sheer,"Personally i love cloth and stone. . this top however sheer is still a nice top to have in my rotation. it is thin, lightweight, and sheer but with a cami or nude bra can be pulled off nicely.. i did find the top to be tts for me but the sleeves were snug. i purchased this on sale with extra 30 percent off so i was justified in getting it..",0

49,53,Elegant and casual at the same time,"This shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line. the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft. the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it. no spare buttons included, but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it. not big enough of an issue to return,",0
49,53,Loved this shirt - but only in navy,This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully. i am 5'7 175 and the medium fits perfectly. i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top. bummer! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up.,17

i opted to have a snap added just above the top button which makes the shirt stay more closed and even-looking, as it tended to gap slightly at the top..

49,56,So soft and amazing,"I'm normally a size small, but the store only had a large. i tried it on and it still fits great as an oversized button down for a threw-on-my-boyfriends-shirt kind of look. i wear it tied in a knot with leggings.

the shirt is so so so soft and high in quality.",0

49,57,Photo does not do this justice,"1. i agree with the other reviewer. the photos do not do this shirt justice. it's very cute and fits well. the photos on the models are terrible.

2. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38 (36d) - 32-40 and the size medium fit me perfectly. i'm often in between a m and l for cloth and stone, but the medium fit well, which means it runs a little big.

49,57,So so pretty,"Sunday in brooklyn has been killing it lately with their tops! i could not decide between this and another of theirs, but i am glad i chose this one. first, the design is great. very cunning style: the sleeve length matches the length of the top tier, which gives this top a very finished look. the color is a beautiful jewel-like raspberry red with a bluish undertone. and, the fabric is a nice washable poly. i wore my usual size xs at retailer.",0
49,57,Versatile,"This is one great button up shirt ! the fringe hem is a fun little detail that gives this shirt some serious versatility. it looks great layered under jackets and sweaters, with a came underneath, or all on its own. the fabric could be a bit thicker. i am between a small and a medium ( a 6 or an 8), and bought this in a small.",2
49,57,,"This button down is to die for! the material is incredibly soft and comfy. it looks great with my retailer leggings, and is also a great look with my casual denim, paired with a cardi and flats or booties. i've worn it several times for different looks and always get compliments on it! definitely a head-turning piece.",0

49,58,Perfect in every way,Tops are a challenge for me. i am top heavy so i often have to size up to avoid pulling in the bust. this one is not over sized in the bust but i am able to open the laceing for a little more wiggle room but still not look like i am wearing a tent. fabric is wonderful. it is not too thin and not too thick.? it does pull up slightly in the wash. it requires a little ironing or a good steaming.,28
49,60,Burgandy plaid beauty,"The burgundy plaid colors are what caught my eye! so perfect for the fall season. i usually do not like off the shoulder tops as most do not stay down but this one does and as others have stated there are arm stays inside to help with that. i stayed with my usual small to keep the length and it was fine. got compliments the first time i wore it. so glad they restocked in my size, as they had been sold out.",0
49,60,Great staple piece!,"I almost passed this in the store, but i am glad that i tried it! i really like that the fabric is so soft and has a ""blouse"" feel... and is machine washable! yay! love nice blouses that don't need to be dry cleaned! i would describe the material as thicker, so some may not like this for warmer weather. looks great with a long necklace like the minuet! i am typically a small and purchased this in an extra-small and still have plenty of room.",5
49,60,Too sheer,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially, then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute, but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.",7
49,62,Poor quality,"Cloth and stone has been getting a little shotty lately in terms of quality. they used to be a pretty consistently high-quality brand, but lately i've been left a little bummed. i got this in ""yellow"" which is really a muddy orangey color. i think i would have gotten over the less desirable color if the fabric were better, but it is actually two very thin layers of fabric that are stacked and snag easily (sort of like a soft cheesecloth). the shirt is definitely comfortable and cute, but the qua",26

50,35,Gorgeous cardigan,I wear cardigans pretty much every day since my office is chilly and i need something a little dressier to be able to wear that will keep me warm. i love the design of this cardigan which makes it very flattering-the longer in front is a style i gravitate toward and i like that the back isn't just straight but it has that little flair-this is not something that is commonly seen in a cardigan (unless it is short all the way around) and it was great attention to detail by the designer. i like the,15

50,41,Loved it but big,This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!,0

50,42,Seeeee thru!,This is baggy on me in my regular size. this happens to be a good thing because it's also very thin...tissue thin... material. the reason that's a good thing is i can wear another t- shirt under it with all that extra room and it hangs nicely. i'm hoping it shrinks a bit when i wash it in hot water.the design on the front is the only real reason i'm keeping it.,4

50,43,Disappointing,I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body.,3

52,33,Really beautiful material,"The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design. it looks very elegant and romantic. you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though, because of the design of the straps. it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering. the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath. overall, very pretty and i would highly recommend. (i purchased the white and yellow version.)",0
52,33,Very pretty.,,0
52,34,Cute and comfy top,"I got this top in a petite xs and it fit just as expected (i'm 5'2"", 112lbs). the material wears like a tee, so it's comfortable, but the front details give it a special look. this is going to be on my go-to list all summer.",4
52,34,Fit is not cute,"I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately, it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger, but just not on me.",2
52,35,Awesome purple color,This is a cute swing top. tts but generous. best thing about it- the color. i got purple and it is so pretty and saturated. i think it'll look great with big gold hoop earrings. alone or under a cardigan or denim jacket. i'd consider other colors at sale price.,0

52,36,Cute summer top,"Picked this up end of season sale, but i go to florida a lot so i will still be able to use it. it runs a bit large. i'm usually between a s and m at retailer and i'm a bit heavy right now but the small fit loose and comfortably. i would recommend sizing down if you are between sizes. not itchy but i would wear a cami underneath because it is white and could start to itch after a while i suppose. it's definitely not a soft flowy t. mix of t-shirt material and linen. the main part of the t is cotto",0
52,36,Romantic top for fall,"I ordered the purple color and the first time i wore it, i received multiple compliments on it.  i noticed in the prior reviews that it runs big so i ordered an extra small instead of my usual small.  it fits well other than the two buttons at the top of the neck are very small and difficult to button.  i'm tempted to order the red color.",0
52,36,,Beautiful top for summer. love the yellow under the thin white fabric. the photo is good representation. running big.,1
52,37,Almost there...,,0
52,37,Boxy or large,"I'm not entirely sure if this shirt just runs large or if it fits oddly/boxy. the flowered material puffs out on the sides a couple of inches under my arms... i'm usually a pretty solid size medium, but i think i'm going to try to exchange this for a small to see if that solves that weird fit issue, because it is a nice idea of a design and comfortable overall. but, if that doesn't solve the trick, if not recommend, b/c that side puffiness isn't flattering.",2
52,37,Cute and fun top!,,5
52,37,Odd fit,"I really wanted to like this top, but unfortunately it is not as pretty or flattering in person. the yellow looks dirty in real life, not pretty like the picture. it is also a strange fit/shape when it is on. i tried it on in the store and did not like it at all.",2
52,38,Love the embellishment,The stitched pattern on this shirt is so pretty! it fits loosely and looks good with a slimmer bottom. it is a little bit itchy but i didn't feel i needed to wear something underneath.,0
52,39,Cute!,Great with a tank top underneath and jeans. i also wore with a delicate gold necklace. charming!,0

52,41,Armholes too large,"With a rather large chest, i am always having to size up in tops like this. the l fit well all over but the arm holes were just too low. even if i wore a navy bra (i got the navy version) it would still be cut too low. it's too bad because it is a beautiful and unique piece",4
52,41,Cute top - metallic threads are itchy,"I ordered the purple and black first. loved both colors, but they ran large and after i tried on the purple i realized the metallic threads in the shoulder area were irritatingly itchy. for reference, i'm currently 165 and 5' 11"" with broader shoulders. returned the larges and just bought the medium purple on sale. waiting for its arrival to see if the threads will bother me after a bit. beautiful, saturated purple color, btw! very true to the image - not cranberry as one reviewer thought.",0
52,41,Embroidered sienna top,Love this shirt! looks perfect with a pair of jeans! makes the outfit with out any effort!!!!,0
52,41,Great tank if....,The detail and design is gorgeous on the tank. my issue however is that the yellow is pretty bright. the website makes it look like a butter yellow but it is actually a lemon yellow. i do not care for that shade and would definitely limit what i paired it with. bummer!,2

52,42,Scratchy,"Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric, it's very scratchy.",0
52,43,Beautiful but boxy,"This shirt is super cute and stylish, but too wide for my liking.",0
52,43,Could have been great but just ok,"Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also, it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however, because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.",4
52,44,,I loved how soft the top was on my skin... plus the sexy detail in the back was a win !,1

52,46,Too much fabric,"I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs, however, i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.",0
52,47,Beautiful color,"I kept coming back to look at this vest for the color and design and finally gave in. vest is my favorite when dress layer. i hesitate because no descriptions about the model height, the vest may look perfect on her and look like a maxi dress on my 5'4"" body. it turned out just fine. the front is below my knees like the picture of the model. i love the beautiful red and the material that stretches just enough for my arms to move around . this is definitely a good buy.",3
52,47,,"This is a beautiful top. i purchased this in the green/moss color. it's reminds me of a vintage looking blue-green. it fits generously, has more of a swing style to it. i love it! i think it is romantic and feminine. glad i made the purchase. simply beautiful.",5

52,55,Wanted to love it,"I had such high hopes for this, but the fit was really strange. i ordered my usual size small, but it is huge. the sides of the top are very wide and boxy, and the back hangs far from my body, very droopy. even if i got a smaller size, the design/fit is not for me. i like the linen front of the blouse, though it is quite sheer. the fabric on the back has a pretty design, but it appears to be stamped on thin black cloth, rather than the richly-colored fabric i saw in the picture. i am truly disap",0

52,57,,"Love this tee! the fit is true to size, and very flattering shaping. not too tight, not too baggy, good length. i love the stitching detail on the top. the material is thick enough that you are not forced to wear a cami under it. my only concern is that it says to hand wash, dry clean acceptable. i have had some bad luck with retailer tops shrinking. i'm not going to risk it and dry clean it. normally i would not want that expense or hassle.",8

52,63,,"This piece is almost what i want... i tried on the white version in an xs and it felt a little too large for me, even though it's meant to be a looser fit. the buttercup yellow behind the lace is very pretty - i especially love that part of this tank. it provides a nice contrast and allows the detail to stand out. the navy is also nice (it was on display next to the white and looks better in person than online). what i didn't like was the texture of the spandex on the back portion. it looks like",38
52,64,Cute and comfortable,"I was surprised how soft and comfy the fabric is on this top. when i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off! it's a little bigger than i would like - i got a small, and am usually between xs and s. may have sized down if the top were available.but the fit and cut are flattering.",0
52,68,Love the beading details.,"This romantic top has lovely embroidery and beading details. i purchased this in purple, which is actually more of a cranberry color. i like that the detail work carries over to the back on the cap sleeves.",3
52,71,Too loose and swingy,"Was not flattering on my body - i have a fuller figure, and this just made me look like i was pregnant.",1
53,20,Gorgeous colors,"The colors and design are stunning in person. it is one-size and as most kimonos go it is billowy and flowing, and not fitted. i plan to wear it with a pair of black shorts and also with black leggings. i love the idea of layering this over shorts. i have a similar kimono and wear it as a bating suit cover-up. the long kimono over short looks fresh and modern and gives you the option to have some coverage when you want it. also, really pops over simple black leggings and black top. it's light an",5
53,29,,"Beautiful fabric! unfortunately, i had to return it. after just one wear, it had pills all over the side. fabric is too delicate. sad to return!",1
53,34,Material is awful,"Love retailer's kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately, when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time, there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money.",1
53,34,"Super-thin fabric, but really pretty","The fabric is so thin, i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normal-sized letter envelope. the problem is not going to be that the garment is see-through (which it is) - it's the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky, it's cotton-ey, and i suspect it will get ""stuck"" against the back of my shirt/pants while i'm wearing it and not drape nicely. i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properly.....

however, i'm such a sucker for a pre",0
53,36,Perfect summer wardrobe addition,"I've been eyeing this for months and finally bit the bullet and am so happy i did before it sold out! i love it. i was afraid i couldn't pull it off because i'm 5'3 and very petite, but i don't think it matters. it feels so light and airy and i can't wait to wear it at the pool and the beach as well as over some white tank tops and jean shorts. great piece.",1
53,38,Easy flowy addition,"The only thing i didn't like about this is i wish it was a little bit shorter, but otherwise great! throw it on with pants and add a bit of color and spring/summer'ness to your outfit!",3
53,40,Beautiful but won't last!,"I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.",1
53,42,Super cute but.....,This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!,49
53,43,Quality does not merit cost,"I generally don't write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing.",108
53,43,Unimpressed,"I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly, i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat, the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap, which i love.",1
53,43,,"This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling, it is going back for good. such a shame!",14
53,44,"Beautiful, maybe a bit ""too delicate""","I absolutely love the look & style of this piece! perfect for summer evenings. only complaint is that it feels maybe a bit too delicate. fabric is quite lightweight, and may be easy to tear. i will be taking special care of this & hoping to keep it looking great for the season.",9
53,45,,"Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item! 
however, the item came with unrepairable holes, not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap. didn't even try it on. so sad, but i still love retailer!!!",0

54,23,One of my favorite purchases!,"I love rifle paper, and when i saw this dress online, i knew that i had to have it. this dress is even prettier in person than it is in the picture. it's pretty and delicate, and can easily be dressed up or down. i found this dress to fit true to size. it definitely has that ""baby doll dress"" fit to it, but i love it! this is a dress that i'll feel beautiful in and pull out of my closet over and over again.",0

54,28,Very pretty dress but runs big,"Beautiful print and a flattering cut. however, the proportions are off. based on other reviews, i ordered a petite (i am 5'4"" and don't normally need a petite cut). i also ordered a size down. even the 0 petite requires that i wear 3-4 inch wedges and pin the top in the back to keep it in place. i am going to take it to a tailor to have the hem shortened and the top sleeves adjusted...then maybe the v neck won't be almost to my belly button.",1
54,31,In love,"I swooned over this dress when it first came online. i had never worn a petite size before so i wasn't sure about the fit. i am curvy (34dd-27-42) and normally wear a size 8 dress, but the 6p fit me like it was made for my body. i think this is because the dress runs large, but i really really enjoyed the fit. the quality of the lace is evident immediately and the color is more of a cornflower blue, which i adore. the lace feels like a soft cotton, but has a lot of strength to it. cannot recomme",3
54,31,Too much fabric,"For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)
i ordered the small and i was absolutely swimming in it. perhaps the petite would have been better, but there was just too much fabric everywhere. the sleeves were ridiculous on me, and even cinching the waist with a belt just wouldn't have slimmed the silhouette for me. i have muscular shoulders, and 34d chest, so the top fit as it should, just everything became way too much elsewhere. the fabric was soft and sw",0

54,34,Picture is misleading,This dress is navy and neutral stripes. not black and white. it fits true to the size width wise but is 2-3 inches shorter than the picture. to gain the length you might want to size up but it will be wider. the knot at the hip is beautiful and very flattering.,3
54,35,Beautiful!,"I love this dress! it is comfortable and pretty, well made and classic. it edges toward the larger size however it is supposed to be big. i got a small and at first it looked too big but the shoulders are perfect. i feel like sissy spacek in this gown and you will also!",1

54,47,A little too boxy vs swing,"Love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online, however, it falls a little short once in person. it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines didn't make it appear as a swing dress, highlighting your figure.

i ordered a size 2 petite, which fit very well. the regular two (in picture) was not as well made. the straps didn't fit as well. they were less of an ""x"" and way more fabric. petite fit great. i think this dress is really fun but not very mature. i returned it because it didn't feel adult enough for the event.",8
56,23,"Lovely, unique and odd","I really wanted to love this dress. two lovely associates paired it with the desideria bib necklace and the black dakota cardigan, which gives the outfit definition and elegance. but the dress by itself would have needed altering to fit my 34-b top. i chose size m because of the length-- the small was 1 1/2 "" shorter in front (i am 5'8"") in the end, i realized i would probably choose my other favorites from my closet. but it will be stunning on the right person.",6

56,24,Lovely but not for me,This dress is adorable but sadly not for me. i had to size up from my normal 6/8 to a 10 regular to make sure all my curves fit in comfortably. sadly i wasn't in love. the bow back hit me right to cover my bra but the fact mine didn't come with pockets as shown was a disappointment. it will be going back.,0

i normally wear an 18, sometimes a 16. stores like retailer are a place i go to admire fun cloths, but not to actually shop. i was concerned that the xl was going to be a fake xl- this happens sometimes. a brand only makes clothing up to a 12, so they're xl is really a 12. but not so! i feel like the xl could fit a 16 - 20. the l would probably fit a 16 as well.

56,39,Odd fit,"Agree with previous reviewer. i am usually an xs p in this brand (5'3"" 115 lbs) but i could not get the internal slip over my head. the chest area was fitted (i am a 32b) but then the skirt was very full and loose. i could have cut out the slip, but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price.",5
56,39,Perfect ice pop for summer,"Like the previous reviewer, my size 10p gaped and strained the buttons at my chest (36dd wide rib cage 5'3"" 140#). also the skirt flared out too high on my waist. i'm going to try a regular 10 with hope the torso will fit better. other than the fit on my particular body and the one distracting chest pocket, this shirt dress is very well made, very cute",9
56,39,Really wanted to make it work,"As soon as i saw this dress, i absolutely fell in love with it. when i got it, i noticed it was slightly small, but figured i could deal with it. i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back. i could fix it, but honestly a dress shouldn't start falling apart before you even wear it. it's cut on the small side. wish i tried the larger one, but now it's sold out. and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured. i",1
56,39,So flattering,,1
56,39,Surprisingly cute,"I wasn't going to even try to see it this dress would fit.  it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model.  i'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it!  my outfit is a floppy straw hat, skinny leather belt and flat sandals.  there's a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out.  i ordered the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#.",1
56,39,White too white,"Loved the dress, but the white of the dress was neon white, way too bright and made it look terrible against my skin. i can imagine this looking good on someone with darker skin. but i""m my pale skin it looked bad. otherwise the fit was great, besides missing out on the petite sizes which are sold out.",1
56,39,Wide and comfy,"Fabric is the nice comfortable hh fabric they have been using to make dresses and shirts. it wrinkles a little though. also feel ""heavy"" though not too warm. i like the collar not being a fold over. teh dress wasn't too short on me (00p) in front, and does go longer in the back (high low) - not an issue for me. i ordered the navy

i decided not to keep it only because i don't really need it and they make a similar version every year. but if you don't have it yet, good to have.

56,40,,"I normally wear a 4, and that technically fit if i didn't plan to sit. i went a size up and it was still gorgeous but now i could breathe.  it is incredibly sexy yet sophisticated, my husband is always asking why i need another dress and when he saw me in he fitting room his eyes lit up and he said you definitely need to get this dress. needless to say i'll wear it on our next date..",1
56,41,Don't buy this dress!! blue stained my dress!,On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.,0
56,41,European flair,"I love this dress!! it has a beautiful european flair, and more beautiful in person. i don't agree with the other reviewers that its see through-the fabric is a good quality, and thicker than you would think. the variable length is the best part of the dress. the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow!",0
56,41,Get so many a+ comments from it,"It is one of the best dress for the season. light, nice color, elegant, can not find more word of it. really great buy! this brand has very special design that really amazed me recently. just want to give a+ to the designer.",3
56,41,Gorgeous dress!,"This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.",0
56,41,"Ice cream, you scream!","I was so excited to get this classic-looking retailer dress- i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print. the popsicle print on this dress is really, truly adorable. unfortunately, the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming: i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest (and i'm only a 32b, ladies, so be warned!) at the same time, the arm holes were huge, i mean massively big. i think if you have a swimmer's body this might work. otherwise, you'll for sure nee",2
56,42,Goofy skirt on this dress.,"This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me.",0
56,42,Transitional sweater dress,"I saw this in the store and immediately had to try it on. it fits perfectly. i'm usually a size 4/6 with dresses and the small fit perfectly. it looks expensive and high quality and the print is unique. what i love most about it is that i can wear it in the winter time, layered over say.... a black turtle neck and black tights... but i think it can also be worn in the spring, especially with that flower print.",4
56,42,,"I loved this dress and after i got it on. as others mentioned, it is difficult to get it on. i wish that the bow snapped on and off. as i took the dress off the bow came off itself. unfortunately going to be returning the dress.",1
56,44,Beware of care instructions!,"I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april. finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar. i checked the instructions and it says ""cold water wash"". so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled!!! looks like the popsicles are melting! i'm so sad because this dress is adorable! i'm buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one. should be dry clean only!",4
56,44,Nice fit but there are issues,"I am 5'2"" and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p. lately i've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress. it fits well and it's flattering. my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy. yes, linen is a wrinkly look and that's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me. more importantly, while wearing for the first time, i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there",1
56,44,Not so vanilla!,"This is a true retailer dress, cute and quirky. kudos for the built-in liner (with scalloped hem, very pretty) and pockets. i like the colorful yet subtle embroidered ice cream sticks on the dress, and the white background makes the colors and details really pop (pun intended!). i echo the previous reviewers that the bust is very small. i usually wear size 4 regular in this brand (i?m 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips. i?m 5?2?, and the bottom hem falls right at the upper knees). but when i tried on size 6,",3
56,44,,"I think the model photo doesn't do this dress justice. it's comfortable and perfect for a summery day. i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan, and of course it works well causally. i'm busty --d on a small frame -- but there's not gapping. the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish.",0
56,45,Almost perfect,"I bought the petite and my only wish, oddly enough, is that the length at the bottom was 3 inches longer! as a petite, this dress his just before the knee and should be mid calf as shown in the picture. however, the design is exceptional and i will wear this all year from sandals to ballet flats to boots.",2
56,45,Beautiful pattern and nice fit!,"Very cute jumpsuit, especially for those who want to ease into the jumpsuit style. it looks very much like a dress but is very flattering as a jumpsuit because of the wide legs. the pattern is striking and bold but not garish. it has a low plunging neckline so you may need a camisole underneath (i did!) even though it has padding for those who want to go braless. i purchased a 2p and it fit my 5'3, 115 lbs frame perfectly. i would highly recommend!",0
56,45,Very flattering dress!,"I got this for a special event and while i had to special order due to it not being in my local store yet, the minute i tried it on was very happy with the fit, feel and overall look. at the event i got so many compliments and love the way it fits - attractive, sturdy and very comfortable to wear, even with kicking up my heels on the dance floor. am so happy i got this and plan to wear it to other events coming up (weddings, parties, etc.)",4

56,46,Classic/modern style,"This dress is made well; the construction/sewing details give the dress a beautiful shape. it has a nice zipper at the back, and fabric feels light. pockets are a good size. skirt flows, but doesn't feel heavy. fit is comfortable. i typically wear somewhere between a size 4/6. i ordered a 4 and it fits just right. i'm 5""6 and it falls below my knee--length is nice. armholes are a bit lower than i thought, but not too low. it's a classic/modern look. it was sold out when i first wanted to buy it,",1

it fits perfectly and it's so classy.",0
56,46,You need to try this one on!,"From the online pics, i would never think to try this on, but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets, so glad i did! i purchased in green and navy... i love the neck line when buttoned up, almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket. super soft material... i purchased a size 6 and i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.",0

56,48,Dress is made for broad shoulders and small waist,The fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible. i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders. what a pity. had to return.,2
56,48,Lovely pattern,"I really wanted to like this dress, but it just didn't suit me. i have others in a similar style, and they are a bit tight in the bust but not too much for me. the print is adorable - very quirky, but subtle. in the end, it's the bright white that doesn't work for me. it made me look incredibly pale.",2
56,48,Runs at least two sizes small,"This is one of the best potential dresses i've seen from retailer, but it needs a do-over. i'm usually a 12 in this style of dress, but i sized up to a 16 (the largest size) and couldn't even button the top. even if i had been able to do so, i would have worn it as a tunic. i am 5'5'' and the largest size would have been a racy mini skirt at best on me if worn as a dress. this dress is fit for only the tiniest and most small-breasted of people. that said, if the company were to try again ne",0

56,49,A lot to love in this dress...,"The color on this dress is absolutely gorgeous, the fabric is great, and the bow detail in the back makes the dress much more interesting. i also quite liked the length. (i'm 5' 5"" and weigh about 132 and bought a 6 regular, which came to a couple of inches above my knee....not as short as it looks on the model.) overall style and aesthetic, i love. 

the problem with this dress is the fit. i tried it on in the store, starting with an 8. too big, no problem. tried the 6, still a bit large (gap",1
56,49,Confusing design,"This dress has a unique watercolor-like pattern and design and is silk, but as another reviewer mentioned it is unlined so you probably would want to add your own slip. the side slits come up high, almost to the hip. i am 5'1"" and bought the petite xs and it comes all the way down to my toes if i don't wear a belt. if i belt it, the length is more like one would expect from a maxi dress. i am a little puzzled as to where i would wear this because the length and fancy sleeves make it seem more fo",0
56,49,Funky plaid!,"The moment i saw this dress, i knew i had to have it. the plaid is beautiful with tones of red, blue and periwinkle. the photos on the website are very true. the unexpected pockets make it even cuter. i also got the sandals as pictured because i love the whole look. i an 5'5"" and usually wear a 4 or 6. i got the small and then wondered if it were too big. i ended up going back and trying on the extra small, but it turns out the small was correct. it should hang and drape and it not meant to be f",4
56,49,Lovely dress,"Dress is made from a light-weight linen and is lined with a separate slip. high quality with nice details and tts. sleeves are average length. length of dress feels appropriate on my 5'8"" frame. hook-and-eye closure at chest area to keep buttons aligned is a quality detail. i think this is a lovely dress that can go from work to play.",11
56,49,Lovely pink and purple for august,"It's impossible to tell, but this dress is made from very fine wale corduroy. the neckline is very flattering for a smaller chested woman, with a sharp cut (that makes a strapless bra required for peace of mind). the dress does have snaps to hold your bra straps in, but i went ahead with a strapless. the back has a neat square cut. the skirt is slightly longer, on both sides, which gives the dress movement, even though the material is heavier than typically used for this season or cut. i wore it",3
56,49,,"This is a dress worth paying full price for, based on the good construction and lacework. i got it for an office event, and although it is low-backed, the high neckline makes up for that! no jewelry necessary with the high collar. i am 5'10 and 135lbs, built like a column, so i got the 6. definitely not for full-figured women, unless you want it long. very cool orange lining and buttons on the back vent.",3
56,50,Busty petites rejoice (1),"This dress is lovely . i am 5' 1, athletic and busty (38 d/dd) - but not super slim so not easy to petite items that fit in the chest/arms. i ordered pm which usually works and it was actually too big in the chest. im waiting on the ps but think it will work since the cut is generous. material/item is so lovely and comfortable!! i never have extra chest room, so this was such a great surprise!! hope the ps is great but think it will be unless they went crazy on making it to small.",15
56,50,More of an a-line than straight,"There were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model, the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now, after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture, i think the model is holding her a",3

be aware that the dress is not mid calf but just below the knee- a surprise but still quite lovely. the lines of the dress and exceptional detailing should make this dress a timeless classic. i look forward to wearing it to many occasions when a lbd would be just too expected!",1

56,51,Try it and you won't regret it,"I picked this dress up off the rack on a whim, and did not expect to love it. i was so delightfully surprised! this dress is made of a lovely, thick, starchy cotton--i found i didn't require a bra. which is great because the back is a gorgeous feature of the dress. the white band across the midsection makes the waist appear small. the dress has sort of a retro feel with the tea length and looks best with heels. i did note a little bit of gaping under my arms but not enough to keep me from buying",19

56,53,Perfect!!!,"More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid",2
56,53,Size up!,"The only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is way too small in the chest if you have anything up there.i usually always wear size 4 dresses. not in this dress! this beauty is a full size too small. trust me it is gorgeous but there is no stretch. it needs a zipper . that said, i exchanged it for the size 6 and all the flaws that i've read in reviews disappear. the sleeves are better and it falls nicely and is comfortable. also, there is no lining. just good to know.once you get it ov",0
56,54,Perfect summer dress,"The cut of this dress is what drew me to order it, but it is so much more! first, the fabric is more of a raw silk, which is more like a soft linen than silk.. it's also got a very soft lining that feels great on the skin, and it has pockets! love a dress with pockets! i also love that the design is on the front and back. i am 5' 4"", 133 lbs and a 36c, and ordered a size 6. it's a little big on the sides, so i probably should've returned it for a 4, but it wasn't big enough to make it annoying o",2

56,57,Loved the color and fabric but fit was not great,I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.,0
56,57,Several issues,I got this dress on line - i ordered several sizes after reading the reviews. it does run small. i usually wear a 2 in dresses and needed a 4. i love the fit and it is a beautiful dress - however the little black pin dots are easy to snag. i wore it once - didn't feel like i was wild that night - ha! - but when i took it off that night it had 3 places where it had snags - ugh!,3
56,58,Lovely fabric and design,"I'm 5'2"", weigh 120 lb.. i ordered p6 and found the torso too short. if i bent forward or kneeled down that fabric would ride ride up into my butt big time. the top was a little loose too. i'm 35ab cup. i love the colors and geometric design. sadly i have to return.",0
56,58,Super easy summer dress,"Love this comfy, breezy dress. so easy & cool to wear around the hood or casual dinner out. i gave 4 stars for quality because of a small gap in seam near one of the pockets, which i'll fix next time the sewing basket is out. i think the double layers of gauze-like material makes the dress a little delicate if you have animals, so be a careful around claws & paws. the back side is straight which isn't as interesting as the front but for my use, the dress is darling.",1

57,32,Cute!!!,"I haven't worn a halter dress in ages and saw this one and wanted to get it, hoping that it'll fit me. 

i love the swing skirt and the halter. this dress can be easily dressed up or down depending on your mood. there is a side zipper. 

i got s p and it hits me exactly like the dress on the model. it is unlined but with the color of the dress, i don't mind it.",8
57,32,Shrank!,"This is a very cute dress. it was perfect before i washed it. the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not, so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two. and since the dress is shorter i can't really wear it without using biker shorts, especially for the back of the dress since it's shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything. i'm so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute, ver",1
57,33,Cute but huge,"I was very excited to receive this dress. i ordered my normal size small, which i should have realized was a mistake. you could fit two of me in that size small. i realize the dress is supposed to be ""flowy"" but it would have been baggy on me at nine months pregnant. the fabric is soft and comfy and the pattern is cute, but order at least one size down. i'm going to exchange for the xs in hopes of it not resembling a short muumuu.",0
57,33,Hips don't lie,,3
57,33,Please bring this dress back,This dress is so cute! will you be bringing it back retailer?,4
57,34,Huge,I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two.,8
57,34,Worth a shot!,"I walked right by this dress until an associate of mine asked me to try it on. i am so glad she did. this dress is far more flattering on me then i expected and it has pockets! after assessing it further, i decided i liked the material it is lined and will not make you look like a wrinkled up paper bag after sitting down. i bought a small, i compared the medium and both would work on my frame because of the tie waist. i am 5ft 3"" 137 lbs 36b chest and i have a proportionate athletic figure. for",13
57,35,Better for busty ladies,"I loved this dress the moment i first saw it! i have another dress from this brand that i've had for a couple years and wear it all the time plus i love the tie waist detail. however after trying this dress in both a size medium (my typical size) and a small, i've given up. it does not look good on me and i think thats because i am a 34b, there is room in the chest even in the size small. so would look really good on a curvy girl! i'm 5'5"" ordered regular size and it came to just above my knees.",0
57,35,Fabric is cheap.,The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it's a printed plaid - not woven.,7
57,35,Flattering!,"Wow, i didn't think this dress would work on my curvy frame. i still have a baby belly and some dresses look like mumu's on me. this was so flattering, the waist cinches nicely and the length is just above the knee. i am 5.6"" and 145lbs for reference. the weight its light/cottony and it looks great with flats and wedges. 
love it!",0
57,35,Lovely,"Tried this dress on in a s and it fit very nicely.  it's a very unique dress and i loved it, but i just didn't know where i would wear it!",0
57,35,Runs large!,"First, i'm an 8/10 and tried the s and m. i could've worn either but the m looked too large in my opinion. i kept the small. the color- i think you could wear black or navy as the navy is very very dark. the only con- the sleeves. they stick right out to the sides and don't lay down as much as the online photo. it definitely looks best with a cardigan or jacket over it. material is super light.",0
57,35,,Love this dress. had to exchange it because it runs a little small. i got the right size and it is beautiful.,0
57,36,Prepare for compliments,"I actually saw this dress on an associate and didn't like it. but as i was trying on other things, i saw my size hanging on a rack in the dressing room and thought - why not, just try it. glad i did! it is so flattering on and you can dress it up or down it's so versatile. i received so many compliments when i wore this, glad i gave it a try!",0
57,36,Staple!,This dress is a staple. if you don't feel like getting too dressed up and want to be comfortable. this is it. will be great for travel as well. i like to pack light. so i look forward to traveling with this dress.,0
57,36,,As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.,4
57,36,,"I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining, but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk, instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well, but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes! 

i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews",2
57,37,My new favorite,I love everything about this dress. beautiful vibrant color and fabric. i got the sp which is a perfect length for me to wear with the jasper & jeera nijar sandles. it is very flowy and full but i love that about it. happy i was able to snag a petite size but i think the regular would have been ok. i could have gotten away with an xs but the small fits great!,1

57,39,I agree,"I agree with all the positive reviews about the look, fit and comfort of this dress.  definitely a four season dress.  for winter i plan on wearing wool tights, wool coat and boots and keeping the waist untied.  for me both the medium petite & regular looked good just a bit tight in the shoulders, since that's how my body is built.  i'm keeping the regular hem version.  my stats for fit reference: 5'3"" 140# 36dd, meaty arms/shoulders/back, small hips, no waist/bum.",0
57,39,Soft and comfy,"And flattering! i love the feel of the dress, it is flowy, loose but still flattering. i can't wait to wear it with boots. i could go with flats for summer, too, if i wanted to. i have had this dress in my wish list, then i deleted it, but it was in the store as a return in xxs p so i thought, why not! i shouldn't have really, coz now i have to get it... and i did.

57,41,Beautiful dress but runs small,"I ordered the stress in an xl. i usually wear a size 12 in most retailer clothes. the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small. also, i felt that i was choking. it is better suited for thin women.",4
57,41,Gorgeous!!!,"I saw this dress on line and knew i wanted it for the spring/summer season. i ordered it almost immediately and i am so glad i did. the photo on the website doesn't do it justice, there are a lot of pretty pastel colors in the paisley pattern that you just can't see on the computer screen. the wrap styling is a very flattering cut for most figures especially hourglass figures like mine and the dress fit's tts (for reference i am 5'9"" and a 36ddd). the silk material is very light and flowy and wi",3
57,41,Nice quality but boxy fit,"This is a pretty dress, but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then ""flare out"" more around the waist down to the hem; however, the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down, which lends to a rather unflattering look.",5
57,42,Adorable,"This dress is really flattering on. fits true to size. perfect length, i'm 5'6"" & dress hits just a few inches above my knees. it's simple, yet versatile seasonally. right now i plan to wear it with booties & sandals in the spring.",5

57,43,Unflattering - too flowy,This dress is so pretty in the photos but in person it's huge. and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down. the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge. i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering. it was also much longer than it looks on the model. i'm not short - in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy.,1

57,44,True black & white staple,"I have ordered many black and white dresses and end up getting cream and black. not this one! this is truly b&w! i love the stripes, the length (at the knee, 5'5"") and the pockets! time will tell in terms of fabric as rayon is not the most durable. the collar seems to stay down which makes it look 70's but fabric tape easily fixed it. overall, i love it!",2

57,46,Red and navy checks,"This is a cute dress, but it runs very large through. if i had decided to keep it, i would have taken it to my seamstress to remove some of the volume. when i ordered, i assumed it was red and black checked, but it is navy. my black cropped leather jacket and boots won't work with those colors, so it is going back.",13

57,47,Better in person!,I was excited to try this dress on in person and so glad i did. it's actually really cute. the material is soft and super comfortable. the dress hits just above the knee and the tie in the front accentuates your waist. i was pleasantly surprised at how cute it really is. i'm excited to wear this to work! worth the price.,0

59,40,A win!,"This shirt is everything i wanted it to be! lightweight, easy style without being shapeless. it is sheer, but perfect with a tank underneath. i'm an extra small, and it fit perfectly - not tight, not too loose...honestly, if it came in more colors i'd buy it in every one. definitely going to be a fall staple!",0
59,49,Compliment after compliment...,I can't tell you how many compliments i get on this gorgeous sweater/poncho! there are tiny glimmery threads woven into it that make it so fun for dressing up. i wore it to a fall holiday party and it was perfect! it's a little on the itchy side... but the shirt i wore underneath solved the problem. the colors are so gorgeous... deep and rich. love this piece!,1
59,58,Sweet little top,"The color is a very soft peach, and the knit top over the gauze is a very light, summer-weight knit. i can see this being worn casual, or dressed up with a statement necklace and nice skirt / pants.",3

60,21,"Love the design, hate the itchiness!","My title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater. the print is super cute and the price point is great, but this sweater was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on for longer than a minute. it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath, but don't even think about wearing it by itself!",0
60,23,Opted for larger size,"I tried both the xs/s and the m/l and found the larger size to be more roomy in the shoulders, and just swish a bit better around the hips. this is a change from many long vests my closet, which tend to be size small or medium, as are my blouses and tops. however, could happily live with either size and color, gorgeous.",4
60,25,Way too big and bulky,"The quality of the garment is high--a nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern, but the cut was totally off for me. i'm usually an xs/s, and was swimming in the xs. the arms in particular were huge and drapey, and the whole thing just hung on me (for reference, i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs).",0
60,26,"Gorgeous, soft, luxurious!",,4
60,28,Georgeous sweater,This sweater is very pretty. i had my concerns being that i don't normally pay $300.00 for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece. i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was. this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come.,0

60,32,Perfect for fall!,"This is such a cute top! i've learned to size down in swing tops or else they look way too big - in a sloppy way. i ordered the xxs (5'3"" and 110lbs) and it fits well. it'll look cute with my black skinny dress pants or jeans. i definitely recommend!!",1
60,33,Effortlessly chic!,"I absolutely love this sweater! first of all, it's extremely comfortable. i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off. it's cute as a casual around the house top, but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots. it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look. the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person. the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with. this sweater is definitely cropped in length, which i normall",0
60,35,Nice fit - super cute,"This top fits exactly like the last photo, which was my hope. it is not as slim as the other images. it's a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size, and the mock turtleneck is not too high. the fabric is thick, so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall.",4
60,36,Love it!,"Loved this vest when i tried it on in the store, and ordered it during the last sale.   i usually wear a medium, and the xs/s fit much better than the m/l.   getting excited for fall!   now if the weather would cooperate, so i can wear this cute new vest!",0
60,36,,"This vest is sooo cute!  i bought the red (really a dark burgundy) and it is perfect for fall.  i wanted to buy the other color but it's sold out online.  i'm 5'3"" and the length is fine.  i'm usually an xs 2 or 4 at retailer and the regular xs/s is the perfect size.  i am on the busty side and doesn't make me feel too heavy like some vests.",0
60,37,Timeless staple in your closet,"I stumbled upon this vest in my local store and i'm so happy i did. i was looking for a classic staple that will be on trend but pass into classic season after season. i wore this with a black 3/4 sleeve top, dark skinny jeans and black booties....perfect look for most seasons in dallas. so happy about this purchase!",0
60,38,Definitely a star!,A must have sweater with great details. it can be a star piece with leather tights or very long flare jeans. i recommend platform booties for perfect body proportion.,0
60,39,Torn,"I ordered the xxs p, but the actual cardigan is a xs p.  i was bummed as the xxs p are sold out. well, it fits ok anyway. (115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist)
beautiful sweater but oh so itchy. i think wool should be listed first (like ingredients) it is really itchy. why i so torn. i want to keep it because it is nice, but it is itchy. i will have to try it with a long sleeve shirt underneath, i don't think i can hang with ah short sleeve or sleeveless. colors and pattern are warm neutral, not red.",0
60,40,,"What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point, i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead, i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s, made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.",17
60,43,If only it looked like the photo.....,"This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2"" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms, you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide, and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure.",8
60,44,Boxy,"This sweater was unflattering me, very boxy and did not fall on me like the model. soft fabric and looks nice off, however this one went back.",0
60,44,Unique design,"I really wanted to like this sweater. it was featured in the dressing room and i am a sucker for animal prints. the dog print is unique, a ""mossy"" fuzzy print, and the grey really shows off the dog print. i like regular xs because i like the fitted look (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls at my upper hip and the sleeves fall a bit pass my wrists. but, if you do not wear a turtleneck under it, you will scratch all day long. the designer should try on the fabric before selling it!",0

60,50,Stiff and itchy,Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back,0
60,53,Beautiful but itchy and tends to run.,"This sweater has beautiful colors & cute fur collar which can removed (nice).  i bought it impulsively.  when home i tried it on with a tee as sweater is warm. i had to take it off immediately as it is scratchy & itchy.  i could not wear this without a long sleeve tee underneath, but i would be too warm.  in the store, several sweaters had thread runs in them and from the weight of the sweater.  given the itchiness and potential to run, i am returning the sweater.",0
60,53,Love this vest,"I first saw this vest displayed in the window and admired the colors and weave. i couldn't get it out of my mind, so i had to make a special trip back to retailer to buy it. it is soft and drapes well. looks amazing with denim and boots. i think it will be my favorite fall purchase.",0
60,58,Fabulous vest,"I was intrigued by this vest on-line but really wanted to try it on first before i purchased it. stopped into my local retailer store today and was happy to see they had it in stock. i am typically a 10/12 and purchased this in the m/l. this picture does not give the vest justice in terms of the way it falls, which to me is what makes a vest a success or not. also, the colors are great. i was wearing a cream sweater and black pants when i tried it on, went great with those colors but i think it wi",7

60,64,Love but itchy for me,"Adorable & unique swtr & wld go w/ many things. note that 1 front pocket is slightly higher than the other. looks that way in the pic too. it's the ""retailer unique touch"". i don't mind abt that. it's too itchy for me. i ordered the sp to have shorter arms-fell just above my knuckles which is fine. i have many t-necks to wear under it but i decided i really didn't need another itchy swtr, so returned. no worry, retailer has plenty of other items of interest!",0
60,69,Amazing sweater!,"I don't understand the negative review
on this sweater. it is nothing short of stunning. the quality and design are absolutely beautiful! and i love the lined pockets! i can honestly say i don't think i'll ever part with it - this is a sweater you hang onto forever. i will say it runs a bit large. i ordered the xs/sm and if i didn't know better i would think its m/l. either way if you can you get your hands on one in store or a return online, do it! it is worth every penny, especially for the s",0
60,71,So cute and comfy!!,"Slouchy, longer in the sleeves, a little cropped, great neckline, stylish.....these are just some of the reasons i absolutely love this sweater! i've been looking for a style like this for a long time. i went down a size because of the wide neckline and the fact that it is a bit oversized. i'm petite, 119 lbs., with a 32f bust size. i went with the grey, but i'm loving it so much i might pick one up in the pink. so comfy and cozy and chic!!",0
60,74,Tunic,I loved the look of this tunic. it is made well and very pretty. it was so big and heavy i had to return it. i think the small in this would be too big.,0
61,23,Flattering,"These jeans look amazing on. i'm 5'5"" and an hourglass figure and these fit perfectly. if you like high waisted jeans, these are for you! a small heal does need to be worn but i wouldn't say they are excessively long.",0
61,23,Great jeans,"Great boyfriend style jeans. run large, though - i had to order a size down.",0
61,30,Disappointing,These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.,1
61,32,Great casual,"I was initially drawn to the shade of blue that these were as i was looking for a lighter late summer denim. after trying them on, i found that i did not want to take them off. they fit well and did not squeeze me anywhere. no muffin top as another reviewer noted. they are definitely a looser fit so size down. i probably could have even sized down again because i found them to stretch out after a while leaving a less flattering fit but certainly still s comfortable wear. absolutely worth a try!!",0
61,36,Stylish and comfy!,"Great fit and dark color; thick yet very soft denim. only surprise for me was that the lacing is in the front (i was expecting it to be on the sides), but i love them anyway!",0
61,36,Super cute & comfy jeans,"I love these jeans. i bought my normal size 28 but after just two hours of wearing them, they had stretched out so much that i could take them off without un-buttoning them!

61,38,Cute jeans,"So let me start by saying i love non-skinny cut jeans. i'm a curvy athletic type with thick legs, so when a jeans comes around with a ""generous"" fit, i'm thrilled! these jeans are generously cut through the hips and waist, giving it a boyfriend type of cut. the denim is soft, like your old favorite pair of jeans that have been washed 1000 times. i did size down one size and probably could have gone down one more size, but i still want a bit of a looser cut. pilcro denim always has stretch in the",0
61,38,Fun jeans!!,Loved the idea of these as soon as i saw them!  great mid weight jean.  a little large in the waist.  the rhinestones sparkle and i received tons of complements when i wore these jeans!  great dressed up or down!,3
61,38,I went down one size too.,"Normally a 28, and on a fluke i dragged the 27 to the fitting room. the 27 hung better that the 28.

i have a belly, but not much in the hips, so this was surprising. most things are too tight in the waist.

denim feels very soft. they may not last, but it's like butter.",1
61,39,A fun and sassy jean,,3
61,39,Ok,"I thought these would be nice, and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these can't be as much of a classic... also, the jewels make the jeans feel heavier. 
fit is like most boyfriend/girlfriend jeans, slightly loose (not as much on me due to muscles) and length on petite was close to what is shown here (typical for me that it is still a bit longer, as not only am i short, but i have short legs for my shortness!)

so if you want that styl",0
61,40,,"I just tried these on today in the store. i'm 5'5 and found that they were definitely the right length for heels. the 33"" inseam is correct. however, i had them ordered in a petite so i could wear them with flats. these are super cute jeans!!!",0

61,44,Great weekend jean,Just got these and they are great..i ordered mine online and took the advice of many reviewers to size down. i usually wear a 27 (sometimes a 26) but got these in a 26 and they are perfect. the material is soft and stretchy. would highly recommend these to all.,1

61,56,Good alternative to boy jeans......,"Let me begin by saying i own quite few pilcro jeans, the script, and hyphen to name a few, absolutely love them, they fit tts, super soft with just the right amount of stretch. the em jean have the perfect retro look, super soft, with just enough relaxed fit to still look stylish. unfortunately, i noticed that they have gone up in price a bit since they were introduced as the signature jean for retailer, andddddd, they are no longer made in the usa, but in china....so you may need to try on",8

62,27,This top looks amazing on the model- not me,I wanted to love this shirt. the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out. the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through.. sadly i will be returning.,3

62,34,Lovely blouse the the v is far too deep,"The fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful, but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look. i have a large chest, but the similarly cut blouse (without the textured fabric - from the same designer) fit me fine. this one is just cut differently. i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail. the photo on the model seems misleading because i don't see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest. i was so",0
62,34,Much too big,"This top is so lovely, but runs soo big. i ordered it online and was so surprised when i tried it on at home. i'm normally a size 14, and i was positively swimming in this top. hoping to exchange for a petite sm.",0
62,34,"Not quite an every day staple, but nice top","I wanted a nice, well-fitting top that would work with trousers, jeans, and skirts alike, and be a nice wardrobe staple. i got two of these tops - one size s (black) and one m (turquoise). the size m is gigantic and i have to return it. the size s is also a whole lotta shirt. the top is really long and has a multi-level bottom, as well as the pocket, making it not just a simple top but a rather ""loud"" top. nevertheless, i'm keeping the size s (black) as a versatile shirt that i can hopefully tuc",0
62,34,Varying feelings and opinions,"As you can see, there is an array of differing opinions on here, and i share sentiments on both:
_______
pros:
- the texture and feel of this is great; it is very comfortable and is different.
- tts for the most part; i normally can wear sizes 10 and 12 (m and l) with most retailer and got the medium and the fit was overall fine but more snug at the hips. if you're more slim/straight, it'll probably fit you like on the model. 
- good length, not too short or too long.
- the mock collar is ni",10
62,34,Wanted to love...,"An odd top.
for my curvy figure (34g), the seam did not enhance, but rather made me look wider.
the material is...interesting. foam-like is all i can think to describe it. the fabric and design are not as elegant looking in person.",0
62,34,Weird collar,The collar on this sweater is too stiff for my taste. the color and fabric is really nice. just wish the collar was different.,2
62,34,,I got the moss color in this cardigan. i'm not sure why these aren't sold out because it is pretty amazing! it is super soft and is a cute addition to a casual outfit. i would say that for this price it's definitely worth the buy!,0
62,34,,"Tried on & bought in-store. so cute & flattering; the picture doesn't do it justice. great neutral piece (more beige than ivory in person). looks cute tied or untied. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs and the regular size s fit perfectly (not too snug, not too loose, and just long enough to cover my bum.)",5

62,35,Great basic tee,"This tee is a great everyday staple.  it is comfortable and it also drapes very well.  i am 5ft 2in, 100lbs, 34b and i got this in xxs regular.  the length is perfect for leggings/skinny jeans, and it also looks really cute with a side knot in front. i have this is navy, green and black.  the navy color is brighter in person and in my opinion, looks better.  you can't go wrong. planning on getting the grey and pink one as well.",2
62,35,Great versatile tunic,"I bought this tunic over christmastime at full price. i absolutely adore it! in my opinion, it isn't too thick or too thin. i got my usual size large and i think it fits perfectly! there are side slits, so it's perfect with skinny jeans or leggings. it's flattering because of the vertical stripes in the fabric. also with the grey color, there is a difference in the two fabrics that are used in the construction, so this adds some additional visual appeal. i haven't had any problems with snagging",1
62,35,Long sleeves if you're short,"I really like this shirt overall. i'm 5'2 and the petite sizes were sold out so i bought a regular. if you are short like me, beware that the sleeves am be almost comically long. while the shirt is stretchy, the cuffs are not so pushing the sleeves up isn't really an option. also, it had lots of loose, hanging threads straight out of the package. but overall, it's a keeper!",0
62,35,Love at first sight!,"Aesthetically pleasing and very well-made. love it! but, does run large.",1
62,35,Not worth the price,"Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life, this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin, extremely casual, not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow.",2
62,35,Pretty details,"I liked the details on the front a d back of this top. while i was pregnant i purchased the white color in the small. everything fit, suprisingly, the top even covered up my pregnant belly. i returned it since i didn't want a top with so much room in the waist area post pregnancy. i recently got this top in the xs thinking that it will be a great stylish breasting top. while everything fit in the hips, and waist, the chest area was too tight. this top did not work for me as i am in between sizes",0
62,35,Soft & cute,"The fun coloring of this tee gives what would otherwise be a basic tee it's flare. it is a very soft shirt and will be cute with anything. the length is good too - you can tuck in or leave out. i believe it is tts. it might be a little sheer in some lights, but i think you could pull it off with a nude-colored bra. it's not sheer enough to me to warrant an undershirt.",1
62,35,,I just bought this today so i can't say whether or not it will wear well but i think it will. i love it bc it's different and super comfy but also stylish. i know that when i wear this other people won't have it on. i think it looks better in person than on this model in picture.,3
62,36,Beautiful top,Beautiful top runs true to size. i&#39;m in between an xs &amp; small and went with the xs. it fit great and was beautiful for holiday photos. it has hints of silver in it.,0
62,36,"Beautiful, romantic top","I got this top in the ""brown"" color, although it is really more of a burnt rose, or light sienna shade and it is just lovely. i love the color. the fit is just right, comfortable and a good length. it feels very well-made and has beautiful details from the pleated collar/neckline to the slightly sheer upper back panel. i have only one tiny issue with this top: in the very front where it buttons, there is no lining or fabric behind the crocheted lace panels. in retrospect, i can see this slightly",0
62,36,Cute but no,This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.,1

62,37,"Beautiful fabric, very casual","This is a beautiful sweatshirt. that is a sentence i've never said before! mine arrived with the sleeves rolled up, which made me think they probably pulled it off a mannequin or something. it made the sleeves sort of loose at the bottom, so i am hoping that they will ""draw up"" a little once i wash it. kind of bummed about that: for almost $100, they could have at least steamed it out or something so i could see the authentic fit. the sweatshirt is a little more square-fitting than it looks in t",2

62,37,"Cute, lightweight summer top","This is cuter in person than online. the scarf goes all the way around the neck and ties on the side as the halter. the whole top is soft like a t-shirt material. there is an elastic band at the bottom, but it's not too cinched so it won't cut into your waist- it just gives it a little bit of shape. it's a cute way to show off some shoulder this summer in a lightweight fabric. i'm looking forward to wearing it out at night with nice jeans or during the day outside. a good price for retailer",3
62,37,Odd fit,"This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath, but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest, but this was ridiculous. beyond that, the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale, it was not worth the price and i returned.",0
62,37,Really wanted to like it,"The sides scooped up a bit too much on me. i was hoping to be able to tuck this into a skirt and wear to work, but there were definitely some gaps that showed the side of my midriff. back it goes. :(",2

62,38,Great unique piece,"I have been admiring this piece for awhile and finally decided to purchase it, and i am so happy i did! the yellow is the perfect pop of color for fall/winter, but it isn't overwhelming or overpowering. fit is oversized (as is in any poncho style sweater) but it doesn't feel boxy or unflattering. if in between sizes, definitely go down. i like things oversized and i went with the xs/s and it fits great. this will be a go to piece for many years to come!",0

62,38,The perfect spring/summer staple,"I have this tee in every single color and love it. this shirt is so soft, airy, and comfortable, and the ribbon embellishment on the back dresses it up a little. i love wearing leggings or skinny jeans with it and accessorizing with an infinity scarf. i normally wear a size small, but i sized up to a medium this time. there is very little difference in the two sizes, but i liked the modest increase in length. i'm glad that i did this, because the tees shrunk ever so slightly after being in the d",2

62,39,Adorable,"This seems like a simple tank, but the shape of it is super flattering. it kind of soles in at the seam, and the shoulders are just adorable and sexy at the same time. i love the detail in the straps, coloring is neutral enough, adn the fabric is very soft... i am glad i finally tried it on, jsut didn't want t pay full price, but broke down as sizes are selling out (smaller sizes, i am usually xs petite and that is gone, so is xxs, so went with xs). i am 115 lbs and 30dd for reference...",2
62,39,Cute tee!,"I saw this in the kelly green color one size larger than my normal. it didn't look much but i was so drawn to the very pretty green color so i tried it on anyway. boy, am i really glad i did! this is more than just your basic everyday tee. the back has a very cute gingham pleating detail that hangs well when paired with a skinny jean or leggings. material was pretty substantial for a tee and definitely not see-through. i am a true m on most retailer tops and this one is pretty true to size. the on",0
62,39,Cuter than i thought,"I saw someone try this on when it was 40% off sale, and should ahve purcahsed it then... ended up going back today for it. it is very soft, adn flattering. also, i purchased the balck, this can go with pretty much anything: jeans, skirts, dresses, you name it - very neutral and flattering fit. nto sure if petite would have worked but too late anyway.",1
62,39,"Droopy front, heavy fabric","Right out of the bag, this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top, though). the fabric was heavy and felt ""damp"" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.
and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the ""v"" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose, droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither ""flat chested"" nor ""busty""",8
62,39,Excellent standard for my wardrobe,"I purchased the black tunic. as others have mentioned, this piece goes great with skinny jeans or leggings. when i'm rushing to find something to wear, this is one of my go-to's. nice coverage. not see-through.",0
62,39,Fun and unique!,Fun blouse for spring with enough details to make it unique and dressy. very comfortable fit. banded bottom which is loose enough to still be comfortable. dresses up a pair of jeans quite nicely!,0
62,39,Pretty spring/summer top,"First, i love this top overall. it is simple and classic and has a flattering, forgiving cut. i agree there is a major design flaw as other reviewers have mentioned. the v-neck is so deep and falls so low you need to wear a camisole underneath. instead i chose to take a stitch at the neckline to keep it together where i wanted it, and that worked beautifully. i think the top should have included either a small button or snap to hold the neckline up properly or should have been stitched together",7

62,40,This shirt will brighten you day,"I bought the ""here comes the sun"" version of this shirt. i had to have it. i'm a cervical cancer survivor who is still dealing with some health issues. i recently attended a cancer survivor event where a women talked about her life with cancer. she said that you no longer counts the years of her life, instead she counts her sunny days. i was inspired to do the same. so, i love this shirt. i got it on sale, but it still could've been cheaper.",0
62,40,"Very thin material, not flattering","I was very excited about ordering this top as i'm tall girl (6 ft) and i like my back well covered. i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material. this top is incredibly thin and see through. though fabric is nice and soft, it feels more like a pajama top. all curves & bumps immediately stand out and it doesn't look flattering. i ordered 2 colors grey and black size large and returned both, although they were true to size",0

62,46,Didn't love the fit.,"I'm tall (5'11"" and busty) and found this top to run on the short side. as others have said, the material is soft and stretchy, but the rouching created a bit of a bulky look. i returned it.",0

62,53,Stiff silver lace,"I hate to be so negative but i can't believe this shirt has so many positive reviews. it is stiff, silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest. adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse. looks cheap.",10
62,53,Would definitely recommend,"This top is just as pretty in person as it is online. i usually buy petites, but ordered this one in the regular length and i'm glad i did. perfect on me at 5'2"". my usual size medium fit great everywhere else too. love their fabric choice as well. i'm getting really tired of the thin cottons and slub jersey materials being used so often now. deletta made my day once again!!!",18

62,54,Comfortable top,I have these tops in white and blue. very comfotable to wear. the back part swings with movements and is flattering. good price so i got one for my daughter!,0
62,54,Pretty tee,"I purchased the blue and it's a wonderful deep blueish purple. i like the chiffon detail which makes it a bit more stylish than a normal tee. fits nicely, a bit big but not enough to go down a size. the material is not sheer and a nice light weight.",0
62,55,Awesome!,"Good quality, cute and great color as pictured. perfect for leggings or tight ankle pants.",8
62,55,Feminine and flattering,"Love this blouse. i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs, which fits perfectly. not form fitting but flattering; washes beautifully, too. i highly recommend this blouse.",3
62,55,Lovely top,"I purchased this top in the white and love the contrast between the stripes and floral pattern around the neckline. it fit perfectly, however i'm concerned that it might shrink because then it would be too short. i am 5'3"" tall, 120 lbs. and small busted. it draped really nicely. small would give me a little more length but may be too loose.",14
62,56,Amazing,"As previous reviews have stated, this blouse is see through but it is amazing!!! very rich quality and can be dressed up or dressed down. it is well worth the price now that it is on sale!",0
62,56,Flattering top,"When i first tried this top on, i didn't like it because the chest just spilled open. i saw it on someone else and it was so flattering i gave it another try. i bought it in both the red and the black, and plan to put a stitch or safety pin through the top to keep it closed. it is very slimming and hides tummy/muffin top issues. i plan to wear it with the stretchy knee length maeve pencil skirts all summer, along with shorts and pants. give this one a try!",5
62,56,Perfect for summer!,"Love this top! it's pretty, unique and well made. i did size down to a small for reference and still have a slightly oversized look.",12
62,56,Perfect work top! a bit sheer!,"Nice work top! i ordered the slightly yellow ivory print, which is beautiful, and the print placement perfect. even better, it's work appropriate. the cotton/synthetic blend has stretch without stretching out.

size: i ordered my normal size small for retailer brands like meadow rue. i'm 5'4"", approx 140 lbs, 35-30-37, 34d, narrow shoulders, short arms, long torso.

fit: the sleeves are slightly long, but the buttoned cuffs rest at my wrist. the fabric blend allows this top very good drape. i like",23
62,56,"Simple, light","This is a simple, light-weight tunic top. the construction is fine. overall, i'm happy to see a basic executed well.",10
62,56,,"This is a stunning top but it did not work for me because it looked like a maternity top on me.. i think a person needs to be thin with a small bust to carry this off. this would look good with many things, from ripped denim to leather pants, and is not necessarily just for holidays.",2
62,57,Ribbed cardigan,This cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer. the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap.,2
62,57,,The style and color is very nice but the fabric is a bit stiff. the fabric doesn't have much give and isn't as comfortable as most of my other retailer t shirts. still a cute top for the cooler weather.,1
62,58,Classic but with an edge,"From the images, it looks like a basic black cardigan. look again because it's a beautiful fabric and can be dressed up or down. i'm 5""1 and always wear an xsmall at retailer however i thought it to wear over other articles vogue clothing i'd size up. it fits perfect i did an xsmall petite and couldn't be happier",8
62,58,This top is so cute!,"Saw this top in store months ago but couldn't justify paying full price. when i saw it on sale i had to get it! it's flattering on both me and my mom, and we wear xs and l - good for a lot of body types since the fit is more loose. the top is more sheer than pictured, but it should be fine with a tank underneath. i plan on wearing it when going out with friends :)",0
62,58,Too much fabric in the wrong places!,"Usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes. this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee. it was baggy, hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless.",0
62,59,Beautiful print,"Unfortunately this was too low cut for me,so i had to return it. i wish the neckline was higher. i could tug it up but it slipped right back down. the fabric is a perfect spring weight and the floral pattern is lovely. on me the ties, no matter how i fiddled, didn't cover the cleavage issue and i am a aa!",17
62,60,Emroidered lycra top,"Very pretty as shown, runs true to size, however fabric is scratchy on skin.",1
62,60,Love it!,"I think this top is great. it does show cleavage. also, it's very romantic. i can't wait to wear it. if only the store had had the red and wine colors in stock too.",0
62,61,Awesome look & feel,"I bought this originally for my daughter but fell in love with it when i tried it on and kept it for myself! it is a cotton/polyester blend so it is very comfortable to wear. the length fits nice as well. i have received so many compliments wearing it with dress pants and also with jeans! thank you for making an item that is both pretty, flexible, and meets the needs of young women (and their moms!)",0
62,61,So comfy!,"Bought this in my usual size small and it fits well. i wear it around the house constantly to stay warm this winter. it is so very warm and comfortable. very easy to wear. could be worn out, but i prefer it with lounge pants due to the comfort and warmth it provides. it is a nice neutral and can be worn with many other retailer casual clothes. highly recommend!",0
62,61,So-so,"Didn't love it, didn't hate, rather indifferent. the grey was a little more muted than i wanted for a summer tee.
i'm 5'4"", 123lbs, 34a, the xs fit if it wouldn't shrink, if you're about this size but larger busted go with the s.",4
62,63,"Bulky, unflattering",I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.,4
62,63,Cute and comfy,"As t-shirts go, this one has a flattering fit...shapely waist yet not so tight that unwanted curves show. i bought the striped one in my usual medium and it fits perfect now, so will have to be careful when washing. if it were available, i would have tried the large, so if you're a tad senitive about tight clothes i suggest upsizing. it's a nice weight fabric and the details around the v neck are great....the v dips just like the photo - approprialty sexy and age appropriate (i'm 62, 5'3"" at 125",0
62,63,Cutest ever!,This is one of the cutest tops i've ever gotten from retailer. the material is very soft and flowing. it fits true to size and hange beautifully. love it. i should have gotten he turquoise one too!,1
62,64,,,0
62,65,Beautiful akemi and kin detail!,"This is a bit pricey, but i think the akemi and kin quality is worth the price. this photo is quite inadequate to let you see the gorgeous dye color and floral detail. the sleeves are upturned and tacked; the curvy hem is very flattering, and the designer added a small triangle of cloth at the top of the curvy side, just to add to the careful, custom detail. the 60% cotton/40% modal is deliciously soft. the fine detail in cut, fit, artistic design will make this not simple tee a divine pleasure",10
62,66,Festoon tee,True to size and lovely colors. bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it.,0
62,68,Not flattering on me,"This top is very soft and well made. for my short and curvy figure, it is very unflattering. i considered altering it, but there is no way to do it. it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all, it won't show because this top is boxy and full in that area. if you are tall and slim, it might be perfect, so give it a try.",1
62,68,Perfect tee,I love this tee. it is light weight and fits perfectly. the additional accents like cuff work and detail around the neck makes it original.,0
62,68,The best basic tee,"If you like a slightly heavier, non/clingy basic tee, this is it. i wore the long sleeved version all fall and winter, rotating colors, and i've been wearing these with shorts and leggings since i got them. the colors are great, fabric is quality, and the ribbon detail in the back gives these a little flare.",0
62,69,Beautiful shirt,This shirt is true to size. it has beautiful detail and feels very soft and comfortable. it can be worn to dress up jeans or with a skirt for a night out for dinner.,4
62,70,Comfort & style in one great top!,"The design is loose and forgiving, and it is very comfortable. the fabric is soft and light weight, and i love how the sleeves are full cut so even those without stick arms can fit in them! it drapes beautifully and is quite lovely on. you can easily dress it up with jewelry or wear it over jeans for a great go-to top on the weekend. i also bought the purple version - it says it's mauve in the description, but it's really more of a pale lavender color. still very pretty, but i wish it was mauve!",2
62,70,Fabulous top,,0
62,70,Super cute,"Can't say how much i love this top - ordered on a whim and when it arrived i was so pleasantly surprised. the sweatshirt fabric is thick, the under layers are high quality sheers. super easy to dress up or down - i wore it to a (casual) company holiday party and got tons of compliments. bonus that i just had a baby and the top seemed to hide my not-quite-prepregnancy body, but will also look great when i am back in shape. a definite keeper!",0
62,71,Great t shirt!,I love this simple but stylish t shirt - the fabric is soft and it fits true to size and i knew i would love it even before it was delivered. i recommend it!!,1

62,72,Great look,Got for a mother  day gift.  think  she will like it because she always at the beach and is very happy go lucky new mother.,5
62,79,Very flattering!,"Finally a white top that is not see through! this tank is very form fitting and flattering, but does not hug too tight. i am neither large nor small breasted and love the way the v-neck fits on me. for reference, i am 5'2, 105#, 32c and i got the xxs.",0

63,34,Elegant sweater,,0
63,36,Comfy and practical,"I bought this cardigan in grey. it's sturdy, soft, great layering sweater over a top or even under a heavier sweater. the tail in back is long and unique. the shape is flattering. and for a lighter cardigan, it's more substantial than others out there. the sleeves are long enough for my long arms, which i love.",0
63,36,Fabulous long-sleeved cardigan,"I ordered in this in the kelly green and loved it so much i wore it the very next day after it came in the mail. the green color is gorgeous and easily complements so many other colors in my wardrobe. the cardigan itself is super comfy and i love the full length long-sleeves! so many cardigans these days come with 3/4 length sleeves, which are fine, but sometimes you want a long sleeve. the fit almost runs on the larger side, but i think that a slightly looser look works well for this cardigan,",0
63,37,,"This tunic looks awesome in the picture. however, it is made of an uncomfortable sweater-like material not left of centers normal skin cotton. i was disappointed once i saw this in person. not a great material for summer.",5
63,43,Too much sweater,"I couldn't wait to try this on this sweater.  sadly, it was too large in all ways.  the sleeves are adorable, but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms. this was much longer on me than the model.  it stopped mid-thigh.  the quality seemed fine, but it is a thin sweater.",0
63,43,,I love the details that this cardigan has. try it!,1
63,44,,"Super soft, cozy cardigan! i have a long torso and this is just the right length to cover my behind! i wish retailer would carry more sweaters with this shape. the sweater is soft and light - perfect for every day and you could wear it year round, although with its lighter weight, it might not be as perfect for winter. i purchased this in the kelly green color and it's gorgeous. i have it on right now!",0
63,45,Great length,"I'm a little on the short side, i was afraid it was going to be too long in the back. the sweater is perfect all the way around. i like the looseness in the front and like the way it lays in the back. the color is great.",0
63,46,Comfortable and casual,This sweater is a nice addition to a fall or spring wardrobe. it must be layered as it is sheer. i read a review about snagging but i have not had this issue as of yet.,0
63,46,Too small!,"Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey, like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so, it doesn't look at all grey irl.

i'm still recommending because, if you get the right size, and like the colors, it will be a nice, light and comfy swea",1
63,47,Midnight dream,"Perfect for dressing up or dressing down with a pair of jeans. this pullover can be worn during all four seasons of michigans weather, which is a bonus for me. it can also be paired with heels, booties or flats making it extremely versatile.",1

63,50,I'd rather pay property taxes than buy this one!,"Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $128 they are asking, i would be a tad skewed. not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling. doesn't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer. i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again. big loser.",7
63,56,"Pretty color, but runs big.",".unfortunately it hit at the widest part of my hips, so it wasn't very flattering. the point in the back was also kind of odd, and off center. i had to return. pretty color, though.",0
63,72,Love,"Runs small. great quality. haven't washed it yet, but guessing it will shrink if i dry it. awesome texture- waffle knit. i got the stripe. it has a removable palm tree pin!",0
64,26,Love this but there are some flaws,"I absolutely adore this top. the design on the front is super bright and beautifully done, so beware if you do not like bright colored patterns. i normally wear a size medium and bought a large in this shirt because of reading other reviews, i am glad i did so. i have broad shoulders and muscular arms, and i believe a medium would not have fit my arms and shoulders. however, it is a little boxy in the torso area because of the extra material. therefore, i feel a large feels like a medium in the",0
64,30,Even more beautiful in real life,"The colors are really lovely--bright and vibrant. the sleeve and back fabric is comfortable and breathable. it is dry-clean only because of the brocade, but definitely worth it! i'm usually s but preferred the xs fit.",0
64,36,Perfect summer tee,This tee is amazing. it's light weight and perfect for the summer heat. the detail of the cross and tie back is perfect to elevate the style. this is going to be a solid staple in my tee collection. i wish it came in other colors because i would buy them all.,3
64,36,Unique statement sweater,"This sweater is so unique. not for the faint of heart but it's beautiful. hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired. the colors are saturated, vibrant. love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back. the front material is slightly stiffer. i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i'm willing to overlook it. will be a great sweater for the holiday season. wear it with a skirt, jeans, skinny cargos. endless possibilities.",0
64,38,Hospital white lace on top of taupe sweatshirt,"The fit of the top is true to size, but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy, but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail, i'm absolutely sending it back.",1
64,39,Unique but a little short,I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size.,14
64,41,Great sweater,I absolutely love this sweater. it is a beautiful deep blue color. i love the unique cuff on the sleeves.. i feel it does run a bit big but once you pull the strings it shortens up dramatically. looking forward to late summer and early fall so i can wear it!,1
64,41,Note this is a crop top,Listed on the package labeling but not in the product description. i am short in the waist and this is still much shorter than pictured. disappointed to send this one back as it's otherwise perfect.,0
64,43,Not for the petite,"I love the design and color of this cardigan, and the way it was styled in the store display made me snatch one up right away. but unfortunately, it's huge and shapeless (i tried size xs/s) and i'm a waif (5'2"", 105#) - i think it could drape nicely on a tall woman but if you are small to average in height it'll hang down somewhere mid-thigh or even lower. you can snug up the ties, as they are threaded through the cardigan like a drawstring, but that just made it look bunchy and even more shapel",6
64,44,Fun and adorable!,I love this sweater! i tried it on at the store and had to purchase! it's even cuter on! i am normally between a small and a medium but decided on the small as it has a loose look. perfect weight for summer!,2
64,46,Prettier in person,I love this! the contrast in much prettier in person.,0
64,49,Dry clean?!,This is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer,7
64,49,"Pretty color and pattern combination, boyish style","The colors and textures on this top are fun. however, the boxy shape isn't very flattering and poofs out a bit around the belly. maybe it would look a bit more feminine on someone with a curvier chest. i would size up if between sizes because the top part around the arms is not very roomy. i tried it on at the store but decided to pass because the xs was a little tight around the arms but the s billowed around the belly too much. still a cute piece if it works for you fit-wise.",0
64,57,Comfy go-to cardigan,"I bought this online days before my trip to seattle. i read the reviews so was aware it runs large...and it does. i practically lived in it the whole time i was there. it's very comfortable and once it cools down here in so cal i'll be back in it. some reviewers mentioned it bunched up when tied but didn't like the ties hanging loose. i just looped each one and it works great. 
it really runs large. i bought their smallest size and had ample room.",0

65,20,Simply floaty,"I purchased the white in the store in a size 6. 34d. i ordered the black online in a 6 and the lining was a bit snug. (i can maybe remove the black lining) however, i really like how the peplum looks. the v neck and bra friendly design are a perfect marriage. i see wearing these through the fall with a denim jacket or cardigan. for now i am enjoying how floaty and feminine i feel. i think this is a perfect top for women with a larger chest as it gives a nice shape but doesn't look maternity or b",1

65,23,Adorable,"I am partial to maeve tops, i love the prints! i loved the ski print as soon as i spotted it. i think its such a darling shirt for winter. the material is light weight which is perfect for layering, i'm planning on wearing it with my fur vest as well as a knit vest i got at retailer last summer. i got a 4 (i go between 2 and 4) because i prefer some room in button down shirts and it fits as planned. i wanted to wait for it to go on sale but i was worried about selling out so i picked up on black f",1
65,23,"Beautiful design, way too large","I love almost all tops from retailer, however this one was just enormous. it is beautifully designed, but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldn't believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i would have loved this shirt if it hadn't been so big.",1
65,23,No more rainy day blues,"I had my eye on the umbrella print shirt for a while. i was able to scoop it at a small discount. i typically get a 2 in maeve tops but per the reviews i got a 4, i definitely could have done with a 2 but i'll probably stay with what i have. adorable print, comfortable, well made.",2
65,24,Cute pattern but design wasn't flattering,"I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers, i didn't find that the top fit small, but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls, but i'm very tall and broad shouldered, so it didn't look as good on me.",1
65,24,Love it!,"I had 3 shirts from clearance in my hand but put them back to get this shirt. it's perfect! great with skinnies/sandals for the spring, or boots/leggings for the fall. great for layering and so versatile...i will get more wear out of this than my 3 clearance shirts combined. i like the slit in the side, it makes flowy while also preventing it from looking like a maternity shirt. the only thing i would like is if the shirt was a little less see-through. it's not bad, but i will definitely have to",2
65,24,Love the fit!,I adore this blouse. i bought it in the blue at my local store and ordered the white! so cute. be careful- i dried my blue one (i openly did not read the care instructions..haha) and it shrunk a little. still beautiful though!,1
65,25,Loved but... horrible quality,"I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn't wait to wear it. after one day of wear, i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem. this shirt was not tight on me at all. very disappointed.",0
65,25,Quirky staple,"Let me just say the ski pattern is the cutest thing i've ever seen!! i literally bought it as soon as a saw it. i got a size 2. i'm usually a 0 or 00 in most blouses and shirts, but i wanted this to be a litter looser so i sized up. it's definitely not oversized even though i sized up. the fit is a little boxy and a little shorter in the front - really flattering in my opinion. the material is really nice and it can definitely be dressed up for work or dressed down with jeans and a chunky scarf!",1
65,25,,Very cute top. flowy and feminine. love that it has the little clips on the shoulders to attach to your bra strap to keep the sleeves from falling down.,1
65,26,Because you can't have enough cream tops,"I waited so long before trying this on because i have a bad addiction to white/cream tops that i'm trying to get over and branch out, but after seeing someone else wearing it i decided to give it a whirl. i was also trying on the black and white charlie's with the leaf print at the time and fell in love. it hits me a lot longer than the modeled photo (i'm about 5'7"" for reference) and the shoulders were a little tight for me in my usual small, so i got a medium. the sleeve length is perfection,",10
65,26,Nice shirt,"I really like this shirt. the design and colors are very good. i ordered the black one with cats, it was cool. however, in general i don't like high-low tops because they don't look flattering and you can see that it is asymmetrical from the front, makes it awkward. the shirt's design doesn't make the high-low aspect stand out much which is great. but it is a tad shorter than i would like in the front. it is also loose fitting. it is perfect for a slimmer frame, but on my curvy figure it just wa",0
65,26,So disappointed!,"I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer, but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru, i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down, i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small, and short.",22
65,26,,"I love this shirt! i got the one with the skiiers. for reference, i got a size 2 and i'm 5' 6"", 135 pounds. it's a bit tight around my shoulders, but not enough to make me want a size 4. if you have broader shoulders, a 4 would probably be good. the bottom flares out a little and is cut shorter than other button downs. it's too short to really tuck in comfortably. the print is absolutely perfect. the shirt is soft and very flattering. it's pricey but super cute!!",0

65,27,,"Must have - i splurged on the white style and red style; couldn't choose between the two. shape of shirt worked for me. the white style isn't too thin that you have to wear something underneath. costly for the quality of fabric, but i had a gift card, and it is retailer after all.",0
65,28,Beautiful piece,"I'm in love with this print! the fabric is very soft too. as others have noted it is small in some odd spots and a little big in others, but overall my usual size worked out great. i wear it with a cute belt to enhance an hourglass look, because it's pretty drapey. really versatile, lovely tunic.",0
65,28,Cute top!,"I love the print on this. love. and the fit, for a swing blouse, was super flattering! typically i haven't found that to be true, but this one is so nice! i loved it so much, but i just couldn't find a ton of outfits to wear with such a unique piece. i have been trying to slim my closet so i did return this, but perhaps would purchase it on sale (to justify wearing it less). i typically wear a 4 in tops and dresses and took an xs.",1
65,28,Great cut,"Love this blouse. it has great coverage but is very light (yes it is a bit sheer, but with a nude bra you can't tell at all), so it's great for needing to look professional on hot summer days. the structure at the bust/waist creates a very flattering shape, and i love the bronze gold buttons with the black pattern. i got a 2 (usually a 0 but every once in a while i need to size up) and could've possibly gone with a 0, but am happy with the freedom of movement i have with the arms with the 2. ove",2

65,28,Ski jumpers,"I love the design on this top- so playful! i was super confused on what size to buy since all the reviews said different things, so i bought a size 0 and size 2. i'm usually a size 0 or xs is most clothes, and after trying both on, i kept the size 0. it's ever so slightly snug in the chest area, but the sleeves and shoulder areas fit perfectly. the size 2 was a little too wide and drapey and the sleeves were a little long.",0
65,29,Excellent purchase,Bought with the 25% off retailer was running -- usually a little skeptical of maeve regarding size but the material of these shirts is excellent. bought the ski print and the red penguin print. perfect for low-key and where i work!,0
65,29,Fun blouses with cute patterns,I did not find this blouse to be tight in the arms or chest. (i'm a 34a though so maybe that is why?) i also don't have a problem with it being too short in front. i took my usual size 0. i like the feel of the fabric and the prints are great. the only thing i slightly dislike is the flowy bottom of the shirt. i wish it was more fitted and that is why i took one star off. i got the cat print. the cat faces are white and on random faces there are pink ears or a pink nose.or a winking eye - just a,0
65,29,Mock neck rocks,"I love this top...i waited for it to go on sale, and it was well worth it. it has a peplum bottom and it is slightly longer in the back. i found it to be true to size but if you are going to but reaching up, the arms do run a little tight. overall, the mock neck, button closure on the back, and the feminine flare of this top create a beautiful classic look",0
65,29,Not bad,"I ordered this shirt, aware of what the other reviewers said about it being tight in the chest. it's true- it's a bit restrictive if you need full-range of motion for your shoulder blades, but if you're not planning on doing any heavy-lifting or sporting events in this top, it's just fine (disclaimer- i am small-chested). i will stick by my tts, though, because it was the right fit, despite being restrictive. i was worried the top was going to be a 'hard' jean, but it wasn't. it was nice and sof",0
65,29,Not flattering,"I felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way. the waistband is very fitted, but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips. it's also see through. 

fit is tts.",11

65,30,Great shirt,"I ordered this shirt last week, and i wore it as soon as it arrived. it is a beautiful shirt with an original design. it is rather casual, but you can dress it up with the right accessories. the print appears to be navy (it was advertised as black), and it looks great with jeans. i would certainly recommend this item.",0
65,30,,"As other reviewers have said, this shirt runs a little short and wide. i usually wear petite, so the length didn't bother me. the sleeves fit me perfectly (which is rare in regular sizing), so others may find that they are too short and tight. to fix the boxiness issue, i just stitched 2 of the seams in the back together to give it more shape. since i bought the black pattern, my diy fix isn't too obvious but this may not work for the other colors. it needed a little work, but it was worth it fo",0

65,32,"Floaty empire, classic white","Saw this in the store and had to have it after i tried it on. it's shape is unique, it's very ""floaty"" and looks awesome with skinny cropped jeans & chunky sandals. 
the ""empire"" does hit across the breast line, not below. i thought it added to the different shape, & didn't look odd on me. i am 5'6"" so it might overwhelm a petite frame.",1

65,32,Oh so sweet when it's the right fit,"I saw this blouse referenced online a few times and have a weakness for white blouses, so off i went to my local retailer. this blouse turned out to be delightful! my thoughts: i would say it fits true to size, as a 0 fits me perfectly in the shoulders. it is a flowy tunic blouse that has a high skit, so it's not possible to wear this as a dress (it is very sheer too). i do think this blouse is designed for the line to hit below the bust, so my incredibly flat chest works in this. if you have even",4

the stripe pattern and navy pattern (the one with the birds) are true to the online pictures. the black one was disappointing i",29
65,33,Great top to transition to fall!,"I got tons of compliments when i wore this top out a couple weeks ago. it is a little bit shorter than i thought, and a little bit loose (not ""baggy"" but just kind of hangs). if you have a larger chest, this may not be super-flattering. the color is really pretty and looked great with dark skinnies. i bought my normal size (after trying on a size down, which was just too short...and i'm 5'2)",0
65,33,Wanted to love this!,"I wanted to love this top! on me it was weirdly boxy. it was too wide and too short, and it was more sheer than i expected it. the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly. i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has. i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy. unfortunately it will be going back.",1

65,34,Cute blouse,"This is one of my favorite recent retailer purchases. i wore it to work and a presentation. many people commented on how much they loved my top, and then turned back around to take a second glance to realize it wasn't paisley but leopards and tiger prints. it's really fun and fits well. great for work or dressed down with jeans.",1
65,34,Great shirt,"Love it! the light blue is a gorgeous color. i thought this might be more chambray, but i'm happy it's not. it's also stitched at the top so no awkward accidental peep show or need for annoying tape.",3
65,34,Great.... though....,"Ok, so this is adorable. i am 5'3"" and medium size and had to take this to my alterations people because i loved it so much but it fit awkwardly. the back was too long and hung funny on my short body. after it was reworked, it is the cutest thing i own. they also made the little belt tighter across my waist. it is super versatile. my alterations people ran out and bought themselves one after they saw mine. so---- if you are not a toothpick or tall know it can be amazing with a little attention.",2
65,34,Something a little different,"This top is a departure from my usual style, but i had to give it a try because it looked so comfy yet structured. i wish the material was less sheer as i have to wear a cami underneath when i wear it to work. i'm 5'3 / 135lb and the 6 fits just fine.",0

65,35,Overall a great shirt,"I noted that this runs large- i should say it runs wide. it is supposed to be flowy like in the picture, but i am really swimming in the l. that being said, i worry that if i returned for a m that it would be too short in the front. i am 5'10 for reference, and i would say the length in front is a little shorter than i would like, but it still works. the black and white print is beautiful- i paired it today with dark skinny jeans and received compliments. other reviews about the batwing sleeves",0
65,35,Perfect shirt for work or night out.,"I ordered the mustard yellow in 10 and found the shirt to fit true to size. it works great with a skirt and with jeans but i did need to wear it with high rise jeans otherwise it came right to the top of my normal jeans and i didn't want to risk showing any skin at work. 

the color is amazing and looks good with just about any color bottom so there is a lot of room to have fun with the top. 

being larger on top the ruffles did not bother me at all, but rather act like an accessory - i find",0
65,35,Surprisingly sweet,"Truthfully, i wouldn't have looked twice at this shirt online. i came across it at my local retailer store and i'm so glad i did. the colors are more vivid and beautiful in person. i purchased the small (my normal size) and it hits at the waist.",7
65,35,This is green and runs large,Just tried this on in store. the color in the photo is wayyyyy off. it's a hunter green and dark navy zigzag. for maeve it runs large. i am usually a medium or a 10 and a s worked best. i'm a 36d and there was no pull at the bust. will pick up when on sale (bc a hundo for rayon is laughable).,0
65,35,Tight sleeves,Seems there was a design defect in this item--sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt. i have pretty thin arms so it's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone. too bad because it's otherwise a very nice top.,0
65,36,Amazing!,"Sometimes you have those days where you feel overweight and unattractive. this shirt is perfect for that. it has a chic cut, and it doesn't look like you are having an off day at all. so cute. and i really like the length as well. i usually wait until items go on sale, but this i had to buy right away.",20
65,36,"Beautiful, poor quality","I love this blouse, i've received so many compliments on it. unfortunately i just got it back from the dry cleaners and the color completely changed to a pale yellow! it also ate away some of the fabric, so now it's completely transparent... and i go to an organic cleaners! 

retailer: if you can fix the fabric quality this blouse would be a classic.",2
65,36,Best of maeve,"I love this brand! they produced a number of incredibly cute blouses in 2006-2010 and i've missed their quirky designs. this shirt does not run small. i am usually a 6 and have a little extra room in the chest area, even though i'm a 34dd. the arms are the perfect length as well which is nice as i have long arms. the only reason i did not give it five stars is that i wish it was a bit more fitted through the stomach area. its very billowy. i may take it to the tailor... so cute though! on a side",1

65,36,Fun top,"Really like this top. fun flair, nice quality shirt. great for dressing up with skirt and also would be perfect with boots for the rodeo. i paired it with a skirt and boots for church. wore white cami under to emphasize lace details. super cute. tried 8 and 8p. thought petite was too short in length on me (5'4""). will send petite back.",6
65,36,Great top for everyday wear!,This is a very well made top. i love everything about this top! bought it in both colors. i think it's fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops. i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it!,0
65,36,Green perfection!,"I'm so glad i found this gem in the store, as the online pic does this shirt no justice!  the green version is vibrant and adorable, and this shirt is lightweight, without being see-through.  for sizing reference: i'm 5'4"", 135 lbs, 34c and a size 6 petite.  i tried this in the store in a size 4 and an 8 (only sizes they had) and rushed home to order it online in a 6.  perfect fit, so i believe its true to size.  the little details...the buttons and stitching make this shirt such a winner!",0

65,36,Just ok,"I love good, flowy blouses and like the over sized look, but this one didn't wow me. i thought the quality was just ok. it didn't flatter me. i almost liked it, but i didn't. i'm glad i tried it on, because looking at the pics online i thought i'd like it way more than i did. just not great.",0
65,36,Pretry top,"Perfect for work or going out. i layered this with the reversible tank in medium pink so it would be work appropriate. it did not feel scratchy to me, maybe because i layered it. great buy especially with the discounts. feel like i lucked out.",0
65,36,Weird fit,"I am totally on the fence with this shirt. like the other reviewers, i sized up because my normal 14 was too tight in the chest (a common problem for me). the arms are strangely tight and i didn't get much more room in the bust with the 16. but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny. this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side. i love the pattern and material though, so i'm going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart",14

65,37,"Adorable, fun blouse","I am writing this because my experience with this blouse differs from that of the other reviewers. compared to all my other maeve blouses, this top fits true to size/slightly larger than usual. it's wider/boxier than it appears online, and the arms are totally normal (in fact quite roomy) on me. all the other reviewers thus far have complained of very tight arms/bust and had to size up. i am having the opposite dilemma... given the extra width due to the cut of the blouse, and the fact that the",2
65,37,As depicted but not for me,"This shirt looks just like it does in the picture, and my favorite detail was the buttons. i was a little disappointed in the stitching of the front tucks, as it looked sloppy at the ends, but you might find that rustic/charming. this is a great top for spring/summer. i ordered an 8p, and it fit well everywhere except the chest, so i'm returning it. my bust is about 37""(32ddd), and it was slightly too tight. if i go up a size it will probably make me look bigger than i am, nevermind the horizont",1

65,37,Beautiful transition piece,"Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas, so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect, since the colors aren't look too summery, but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy, but drapes nicely so it won't make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops, this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.",1
65,37,Beautiful!,Beautiful shirt! i recently purchased this on sale and it has been marked down even further so definitely buy it! it is very pretty with the gold interwoven in the material. the peplum is also not overwhelming. it looks great with a pair of jeans and heels. my husband immediately commented on this shirt and he does not notice anything?,0
65,37,Beautiful!,"This blouse was exactly what i was looking for. perfect for those last balmy days of summer. fabric a bit sheer, but it flows beautifully and the pleating details and higher neckline make this top truly stunning. it is very flowy, so if you're looking for something more fitted, this might not be for you.",1
65,37,Cute top!,"This top looks better on than on the hanger. i've been looking for a feminine plaid top and this is the one! it's a flirty and innocent look in one. i would say size up. it runs a little tight around the upper arm, shoulders area when stretching arms out. i normally wear a size 2-4 depending on the top and the 6 felt better.",0

65,40,Great top,This is a great top. easy breezy and perfect for fall in miami. perfect top for spring too. love the whimsical pattern. a great addition to any wardrobe.,1
65,40,Great top!,"Love this top! kept looking online, but really wanted to try on. so once i made it to a store, i was so happy they had my size! i'm 5'1"", but prefer regular sizes in retailer for the length. i got the xs and it is a lovely fit, tts. love the colors in the pink top!",2
65,41,Cute summer top,"This is a great light, free flowing top for the summer. i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area, but if you are small busted, you won't be affected. it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer!",1
65,41,Feminine & fun,"Bypassed this blouse online, but it's striking colors caught my eye at the store. bought the olive green color and it's gorgeous! the color is great for both spring and fall. i'm normally a petite xs at 5'0 feet and 104 pounds, the regular xs is a great fit for me. not too boxy and the length hits right at my waist. material is lighweight and flowey. don't hesitate to buy, it's a great piece to add some pop of color and goes great with skinny jeans..",0
65,41,So pretty,"I bought this blouse after i saw my aunt wearing it. the color is lovely. i spilled soup on it during my first wearing and it laundered wonderfully. i am so glad! such an easy piece to throw on, very comfortable. fit is great.",0
65,41,,"The reviews are accurate that have already been said about the material and size. i usually wear a size 2 and i bought a size 4. it fits perfectly. the blouse is very sheer, but if you wear a neutral colored bra, it should be fine. i like the flow and cut of this blouse",1
65,41,,What a sweet shirt!! the ski pattern is adorable and they have a cute cat pattern that i've only seen so far in the store. the fit is small. i sized up from my normal 8 to a 10 but could have even gone to a 12 as there wasn't much difference between the 10 and the 12 except in length.,31
65,42,Awesome shirt,"This shirt is a 10! i've been looking for an off the shoulder top that i can wear a bra with. i almost never spend full price on retailer items but this one is worth every penny. don't hesitate, just buy it!",0
65,42,Even more vibrant in person!,"The colors on this blouse are beautiful and even more vibrant in person. i love that the blouse is lightweight, perfect to wear to any holiday gathering!",0
65,42,Front slit,"I somehow missed that there was a slit in the front of this tunic below the buttons. it looks fine on, i'm just wondering if i can still pull it off with only leggings underneath (why i got it). otherwise, just as pictured. i'm 5'7"" 125 lbs and got an xs.",0
65,42,Great going-out top!,"Love this top! however, i'm biased bc i love hd, such originality in their clothing, even in something as simple as a black tank top. also comes with the bra strap snaps, but i find my straps still show in the back, need to wear a strapless or criss cross. please note that the sides sort of rise up to meet the laces. so the more you tighten the laces, the more it comes up (hard to explain!). if you are at all even a little sensitive about a muffin top, again with low rise, it would show! still l",3
65,42,Modern baby doll style,"Purchased the cream color in my local store. it looks great with jeans or leggings. i've worn it with a bright cami underneath with a couple of buttons open and it looked really cute too. it is very comfortable, runs big, but it's meant to not be fitted. the addition of pockets, (that don't stick out), makes me love it even more! i will be wearing this from fall to spring. great design, retailer!!!",0
65,42,Too short :(,"I didn't have any problems with the fit, i love the puffin pattern, the material is nice---it's just so short. i really haven't decided if the print is worth the awkwardness of the length, or if i'll just keep it and only wear it when it's cool enough outside to wear a tank under it, so i can avoid flashing my stomach every time i lift my arms. but, yeah...it stops right at my waist in front. way too short--stop making these great shirts so short, please.",0
65,42,Very pretty!,"I purchased this blouse in the kelly green the other day and i love it. the color is beautiful and i like how it hangs/flows- especially the sleeves. it's not warm enough to wear by itself when it's really cold but would be beautiful layered with a cardigan in the winter months and by its own when it's warmer. looks great with skinny jeans, flares and just about anything including the right skirt. i'm so happy i purchased this!!",1
65,43,Darling top!,I love this top and bought my usual xs. i don't have any issues with the buttons gaping but am 34b so i'm not a busty girl. i got the adorable umbrella print and living in a rain forest in southeast alaska it could not be cuter.,1
65,43,Love the stripes!,"I love this cut of shirt. the stripes are fun. i did have to go up a size due to my bust (34dd), which made the lower part a little bit more flow-y. regardless, i still love this top. so much that i have bought 3 of the prints available.",2
65,43,Narrow in the middle,"I love the look of this blouse and i like the light weight material. it would require a camisole underneath but could be worn at the office or a night out. i purchased a size 4 and it fit perfect once i was able to get it on so i wouldn't want a larger size but because it doesn't button down all the way and it's so fitted in the waist it was nearly impossible to get it on and off over my shoulders, there's no give at all. sadly i'm going to have to return it.",6
65,43,Pleasantly surprised by this black gem,,0
65,43,,I originally ordered this blouse to wear for work. i was pleasantly surprised that i could wear it casually with jeans! fits comfortably and hugs my curves!,0

65,44,Amazing. must have top!,I adore this top. the fit is amazing. the colors are vibrant and will transition beautifully into spring. i think it looks great with skinny jeans. i am built small up top size m and the 6 fit perfectly. the buttons did not gape at all.,3
65,44,Great colors but....,"I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp, that's out the window. this design is poor. for one, this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so, without a jacket, i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.",0
65,44,"Overall, i like it, but some sizing issues...","I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down, but i bought it online, so i just decided to live with it. pretty top, though i do think it runs large.",0
65,44,Subtle beauty,"I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod",4
65,44,Too boxy,I had high hopes for this top. i love the plaid and design but found it too boxy and short. the front was cut too low as well.,1
65,44,,I eyed this for so long hoping it would go on sale. i finally bought it during the 20% off retailer members day. sized up from my usual size 4 to avoid the buttons on the bust looking like they were about to burst free. the rest still fits way. i absolutely cannot wait for the next rainy day to wear this!,1

65,45,Fall must have,"Beautiful fall colors, perfect with work pants or jeans. i'm tall and was a little worried it would be too short, but it was a good fit.",1
65,45,Loved this online,"I loved this top online and even more when i opened it up. however, the quality of the stitching is poor. where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides, the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone. i was bummed and am sending it back today.",8
65,45,Super cute,,0
65,45,"This blouse is simply the best, i love it!","Everyone should have this blouse, amazing! simply love it! it does run large, so purchase down 1-2 sizes.",6
65,45,This might be,"My favorite white blouse ever.
i was hesitant, but really love it. it makes me think of summer, flowers, paris.... it's so soft and comfortable. yes, the cut is different and took a moment to get used to... but i like that. and it looks better on. imo. i can see this getting worn a lot on hot summer southern days. i've been on a hunt for a great white blouse for a long time. tres chic!",6
65,45,,"Really flattering cut, this shirt is perfect for fall. got so many compliments the first time i wore it!",0
65,46,Beautiful blouse!!!,"This is a beautiful blouse and well made!!! i read the previous reviews and i'm usually between sizes 8 and 10, so i sized-up, and ordered size 12 and it fits well. i purchased the pink, and it's soo pretty! i'm very satisfied with my purchase, and i highly recommend this blouse.",0
65,46,Beautiful shirt!,This shirt is beautiful and well-made. the lace is soft - not scratchy at all. looks great with a cream or gray cami underneath.,0
65,46,"Beautiful, stylish, goes with everything","This is a cute,somewhat dressy top-- it has a bit of a sheen, ties on the sides, and a zipper down the back. it'll go great with pants or skirts. the fit, though, is huge-- i'm normally an 8, but i got this in a 4! machine-washable even though it says ""dry clean."" if it doesn't say ""dry clean only,"" you can wash it.",6
65,46,Boxy,"Very cute top and nice material, but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small, but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full, probably twice as full as seen in the pictures,which adds interest but was unexpected. also, the arm hole is wide, so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt, which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit, but i'm not sure about this one",1
65,46,Cute and springy,,1
65,46,Not perfect but cute shirt!!,"I bought this in both the taupe and ivory. the beading on the neck line, the tie at the neck and the pleats make this a fun shirt. i bought a size 2 which is normally what i wear at retailer, so i would say it is true to size. i really like the length of the top. it hits mid-hip on me. it is a tad shorter on the sides than i would like but it is still long enough to cover my waistline. i also think the arms are too long so there is kind of a balloon look at my wrists because of it. i bought it to",0
65,46,"Size 16 cut inconsistently, too small","This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders",3
65,46,"Soft, feminine and fun pockets!","I love this tunic. purchased the dark orange in medium (i am 5'9 and 140 lbs). tried the small and almost kept it but i felt seams around my arm pits a tad, so went with the medium and glad i did - this top should be comfortable. feels very fall and perfect for casual get-togethers and running around town. only comment is that it is rayon... and for me anyway rayon doesn't wash too well - so we shall see how this one fairs.",0
65,46,,"I ordered this in the peach color and it is a beautiful pale color. the underside of the cuff has a pretty pattern on it, so if you roll it up once it adds a little something extra! it is extremely see through though so you might want to wear a tank under!",13
65,47,Adorable cat pattern but strange fit,"Love the cute cat pattern and quality of the blouse. unfortunately the front was too short and the back didn't fall properly. also, i found the arms to be tight. i'm usually an xs and a size 2 in maeve blouses. i would've ordered the the 4 but it's sold out. definitely size up if possible.",0
65,47,Great,"I love this. it is perfect. it is sheer, but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great. so glad antro finally has something with a waist! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail. i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one!",2
65,47,Super cute blouse,I love this blouse. the color is very cheerful with it's small white polka dot design. i usually wear a medium but went with the large because the shirt is slightly sheer and i will likely wear a cami underneath.,1
65,48,Love it!,"This may be one of the cutest items that i have every owned! runs big, i am a 4 and the 0 fits perfectly.",0
65,48,Not for me,,1
65,48,Runs small,"This top is so pretty but runs small. i have a 34 dd chest and small back and shoulders . the size 10 was too full cut on the bottom and the 8 was better on the bottom but fit the same on top, felt like the seams under the arms with either size would rip. truly an odd fit and cut. this brand tends to run small and narrow. better for a smaller chest .",7
65,48,So much prettier than pictured!,"I agree with the previous review, i too would not have purchased it if i had not tried it in the store (which is 2 hrs from my house!). the colors are much more saturated but not gaudy. the caveat, it is quite short. i am 5'10"", 135 lbs. i purchased a medium as it gave me the length i needed.",2
65,48,Undecided,Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.,6
65,48,Valo burnout top,,0
65,49,Fun patterns and prints for a rainy day ;-),"I bought the umbrella print in the petite length. i'm pleased with the whimsical print and crisp colors. the fit is just right for me, although the style runs a bit wide at the waist. it's a casual loose fit, more fitted on top at the bust, shoulders and sleeves, and flaring out below the waist. i would wear it untucked over jeans or a narrow skirt. the only thing i'm not crazy about is the rayon fabric, though it is a substantial weight and machine washable.",1

65,49,Great fun top,"Nice quality, not too thin like most white tops and the arms are cut just right. perfect length too.",3
65,49,Great staple,"This shirt is the perfect go-to; classic white button down, with a twist! the fit is flattering & i would have to say runs a little large. i am 5'4,124 lbs, broad shoulders, with a 36d bust and bought the 2 (outside of retailer, a 36d usually needs about an 8). i was worried what may happen when i wash it because it fits perfectly but i washed it in cold & hung it up to dry & it was fine.",5
65,49,Lovely but not quite right,"I definitely think this may have worked had i tried on a petite-sized version for the length. i was not at one of the stores with the petites. i did feel like at 5'2"" the regular size is just too long. i tried a size 4 on with leggings and that didn't look right. the size 4 seemed fine (34b chest, 118 lbs). maybe if i had a different pair of pants on but the slits up the sides of the shirt made it look not quite right with leggings. i kept thinking the shorter size would have helped. i really li",1
65,49,Perfect fall shirt,Comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes. this shirt meets both requirement. it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up. must have for fall and winter.,1

65,50,"Cute top, very forgiving","I purchased this in the 6p and the 8p. both fit similar, but the 6p was just a little more form fitting. the problem i have with this top is that while the top of the shirt and the shoulders are awesome, the rest of the top is pretty boxy. i am a 36c, broad shoulders. i did layer it with a longer necklace which helped deter the boxy look. if the mid section could be a little more form fitting, it would be a perfect top! soft, cool fabric, great for summer.",3
65,50,Revealing,This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.,0
65,50,Soft beautiful top,This blouse is gorgeous on i purchased at my local store i noticed it was $29.99 + 30% = $21.00 omg it's so nice on it's soft and comfortable and the gold threading make it sunning it does run a little small in the chest area,0

65,50,,"Loved this top from the moment i saw it. i was bummed that this top wasn't available in petite sizes, but since it was my birthday i thought i would treat myself. i purchased the xs. after receiving it and trying it on, it was big under the arms and waist area, i kind of expected that since i am always a 00p in most retailer clothes. i had the top altered at a local tailor and now it fits me perfect.",3

65,51,"Classy, sophisticated",I bought this blouse in a size 4 (my normal size) to pair with winter white slacks and gun metal pumps. it was a hit. i felt beautiful and professional. and received many compliments at work as well as at an after work gathering the quality is surprisingly sturdy given the lace work. the collar and cuffs really set the design off. this top is much more impressive in person.,4
65,51,Not for me,The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.,1
65,51,Scratchy gauze,"I am ever in search of a light, white, summer top. this is not quite it. there are two distinct layers, and each of them is the scratchy, starchy type of gauze. it would just roast me in the summer sun--but i run fairly hot in general.",4

65,52,Adorable but runs large...,"I think this blouse looks better in real life than it does on line and i'm glad i decided to try it on. i bought an extra small in the red which i think is the best color. the white looks like a nightgown. too bad there were not more darker fall prints because i would have bought more than one. i think this style would look best on someone that is tall and thin. a petite person might get away with turning it into a dress. i would buy a longer version of this . as it is it is a fun, feminine casu",0
65,52,Cute shirt,"I bought this at the retailer store the other day and i wore it to work and i received so many complements. it has the perfect amount of swing and hides your middle without looking frumpy. i got the blue color and wore it with skinny jeans and ankle boots. the red is really more of a bight pink color, not a rich red as pictured. i wish it came in more colors and patterns...maybe green or purple? it does run big, i usually take a large, but a medium was perfect.",1
65,52,"Cute, flattering top","It's navy and red--the photo looked black to me. so i couldn't use with black skirt that i had planned to pair it with, but it's cute with jeans and maybe white shorts next summer. the front gapes open when you sit down, so i'll either have to pin it or sew a snap there unless i want the world to see my bra. also a little short waited for me--i'm 5""11"", so i wish the wrap hit a little lower, but not enough that i didn't keep it. it is flattering blouse. the shoulder ties add a little extra flair",0

regarding the fit, it is a shorter top, so i am not sure that it would be able to be tucked in a bottom for most people. i am short waisted, and i wouldn't be able to tuck it in.

65,58,Very versatile tunic,"Saw this tunic on line and loved the color combo. tried it on at the store and found it to be true to size for me - i'm a 34 dd, 5 ft 4 and the regular size 10 fit fine. i was curious to see if the petite size would fit best with the loops for the tie belt being a little higher, but none were available. still the regular 10 works well. excited to wear when the weather gets warmer like the model with white skinny or cropped jeans, and wearing it open as a duster with a tank or cami. seems very ve",4

65,59,,This is a beautiful blue color and a fun swing design. it is very short so will be limited with what you can wear it with. looks very cute with higher waisted jeans and pencil skirts. it is wide but has a lovely flow/swing to it. love the fabric and it is a nice change to everyday style in wardrobe. so if you want something fun and flirty and feminine and you do not mind short this is your top.,10

65,60,A little on the short side,"I purchased this top in the wine color and found it to be cute and comfortable. the sleeves are not tight which is nice, but it is very short and moving your arms away from our sides make this shirt look a little bit like a tent. the color is pretty and the button detail is nice.
overall good purchase, but i'm glad i got it on sale!",0

very well made and not sheer so did not have to wear a tank underneath.",2
65,61,Cute top,I liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy. fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me. may look better on a different body type.,0
65,62,Best if tied at waist,"Love the fabric of this button-down. runs really large, however. am usually a small or xs - so bought a 4. it's ok, but is incredibly boxy and stands away from the body -- & not in a good way. i think it probably works well tied at the waist, but, alas -- i am too old to be showing off that part of my anatomy. returned reluctantly! hope others will enjoy!",0

65,63,"Adorable and comfortable, poor fabric quality","I tried this blouse on and loved the style, comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me.

65,64,Elegance and comfort,"I love this tunic! it has an unusual neckline with decorative stitching and beautiful buttons,.i like the slight sheen of the fabric as well. wearing it makes me feel elegant without sacrificing comfort. i'm going to wear it for work with black leggings and on weekends with jeans; i suspect it will also be great to travel in. the only potential downsides might be the deep side slit and the fact that it has to be dry cleaned.",0

65,64,So cute!,"The style, plaid colors & cotton fabric really appealed to me in the pics. looks like it will be very cool & airy for these brutal hot days. ordered both the blue & purple in the size 6 for length. did not disappoint at all! looks pretty much on me as in the pic. a little surprise is that both tops have a thin metallic pinstripe spaced abt 3-4"" thruout the plaid. it's a silver metallic on the blue, & raspberry on the purple plaid. not obvious from far away but noticeable up close. a cute feature",15
65,64,Yes it's scratchy but it can work out!,"My usual size 6 fits perfectly... yes the metallic fibers on the inside are scratchy. a cami solves that problem. when ordering, i realized i cld not go strapless & wld have to wear a one of my wider strap cami's in navy or black to cover the bra strap area. it was obvious some sort of cover-up swtr or jacket w/b needed & wld cover the strap area anyway. so, i also ordered the 'faux-fur cardi' in the ivory to wear over this top. it's a shrug-like cardi w/ 3/4 slvs. comes in the plum also if you",2

65,74,Great for summer,"I tried this tunic at a store and loved it. i had to buy a much bigger size because the sleeves are so narrow.

75,29,Very cute jacket,"Love the swing-style boxy fit. versatile - works well over jeans or any pants and top. like the coated linen (or cotton?) look. serves much the same purpose as any light weight or denim jacket - good to wear over a top to complete an outfit or as an extra thin layer but not a substantial outdoor jacket. really quite cute. fairly tts but if between sizes, size down.",11
75,31,Awesome jacket/blazer,"I own the green version of this jacket and ordered the ivory as well because of the sale price and because i loved the green one so much. i highly recommend this jacket to wear over dresses, with jeans or skirts all year round!",0
75,31,Easy jacket,"Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft, easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket, can be kept on indoors without getting too hot.",0
75,31,Great find!,"I initially ordered a small, but found it looked way more oversized then what it should look like, even considering the style. (i was swimming in fabric!) i exchanged it for a petite small, and it fit perfectly. it goes so well with so many looks, and it is going to last a long while in my rotation. looks much better in person, too. my only reservation is that unlike the original one i received, this one had many threads loose throughout, which i clipped and think will be alright, but i expected",0

75,32,Great denim jacket for a non-denim jacket girl,I have never loved denim jackets because they always have seemed kind of basic or boring. this one is edgy and the design is amazing. it can be worn with anything and will go through many seasons. i found the fit to be on point. my normal medium fit perfectly.,1
75,32,"Too wide, too short",This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.,5

75,34,Perfect fall jacket,"Loved this from the minute i saw it in an email. i got the blue grey in a medium. i'm 5'4"", 140. it's a little roomy but will be nice over sweaters too. i love the cropped length. really well made.",0

75,35,Love! my new favorite jacket!,"I was looking for a stylish spring/fall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill. i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket. i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me. i can't wear it enough! i am a short 5'2"" but 36d and have 31"" waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best. as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room! i am normally a 12/14 so i was surprised by this. if you are on the",0
75,35,So comfortable and chic,"I'm 5'3 130# with a 32dd bust. i usually wear small in retailer/ cloth and stone/ running horses. the small fit me fine, but with no room for layers underneath. the small was very snug. would be perfect for california evenings. but, i live in the north east! the medium still has a great shape on me, still fitted at the waist (27inches), but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under. the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress.",0
75,35,Too distressed,First i ordered a m. i'm normally a 8-10. the m was too small so i returned and ordered a lg. the lg fits great but there is a huge area of distressing on the shoulder that will turn into a hole. i love this jacket but cannot keep it in its condition. hopefully i will make it to the store soon (there are none w/in an hour of me) and look before i buy.,2
75,36,Love,"I'm short and curvy and just had a baby. love this cape because it's super comfy and warm but not too warm. have had it for a couple of weeks now and it's my go to for running around during the day. the description says grey but it reads a tiny bit green - like light camo green but so slight that it still pairs well with most everything. 

usu a med but got the xs/s because of how slouchy it is anyway. med looked too big in the shoulders.",2
75,36,"Very nice, comfortable, great color","Other than the color (i got the rose color), which is great, i think my favorite part about this jacket is that the sleeves are actually long enough. i am 5'7"" and the sleeves come right to my wrists, if not just a tad longer onto my hands. it's also got some stretch to it so it doesn't make you feel to stiff as you wear it; you can move in it :) it's very comfortable and pretty.",1

75,37,Cute layering piece,Bought one for myself and one for my mom.  we both love it.  super soft. boxy and oversized but great for layering over a belted tunic.,0
75,37,Love it,This jacket is really cute. i tried in in a large in the store and was too big so i took a chance and ordered medium on line. i have broad shoulders so i was a bit worried. it's perfect. very fitted and cropped. but will look great to throw on over a dress. for reference i'm 5 foot 6 inches and a 34 c. 132lbs. slender but athletic. medium was perfect.,1
75,37,Omg yes!,"Alright ladies...this jacket!! its even better than it appears online. the green anorak fabric has a little stretch to it and is super comfortable. because of the stretch, i was able to do a large instead of my normal xl. but the real show stopper is the fringed sweater. it is gorgeous. it lays beautifully open or closed and is so soft and warm. the design has so much detail to it. there is also this amazing tie in back so you can cinch the waist if you want. this jacket will look amazing with a",1
75,37,So cute and stylish!,I saw this online and just had to have it! it fits and looks exactly as pictured. excellent for spring or fall.,0
75,37,Terrible,"I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person, it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall, it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon",0
75,38,"Affordable, comfortable jacket",Love this jacket.  it is quite stylish and comfortable at the same time.  i was surprised at how affordable it was.  my only complaint is that it could wash you out if you have pale skin and get the peach color.,0
75,38,Comfy and stylish,"I love this vest and could not leave without it. the color and lining just make it perfect, so stylish and comfy! i'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect. the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down. i am big on the bottom, the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest! love love...",2
75,38,"On me, not flattering","I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer, and would work in an office. but, on me, the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad, the couldnt have done it better. further, the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again, not flattering",14
75,39,Great asset,,7
75,39,Great shape,"I purchased this jacket and the levis sherpa denim jacket for comparison. i chose this one over the levi's jacket as this one had more shape/curve to the bodice, which i wanted. i am usually a small but needed a medium in this jacket-- i have wider shoulders, 34c chest, 28"" waist, 38"" hip, 5' 4"" 120lbs.",0

75,39,Oversized and does not drape well,"I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated, it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.",1
75,40,Cropped jacket,"I ordered this to go over a dress. i wanted the jacket short, to not cover the waist of the dress. on sale, i think it is a great bargain. the sleeves are long on me, but i rolled them, which i thought was intended since they are lined. the medium fit me. i am usually an 8 in tops. the ivory color is almost a pure white.",5
75,40,Cute jacket,"I love the layered look of this jacket. i got it in navy which matches everything. i think it's a little on the large side for me. i ordered a small. i'm 5'2"" 130 lbs. super comfortable. the inner layer is very soft. once you wash it, the outside is soft too. i've already worn mine several times. happy.",0
75,40,Perfect denim jacket,"I am so glad i had read the other reviews of this jacket which prompted me to order. great fit and cut with a hint of stretch, nice styling details, great vintage color. i wasn't in love with the price but after receiving the jacket i would gladly pay the price again. will definitely be in my wardrobe rotation for years to come!",1

75,42,Classic and edgy all-in-one,"I haven't owned a denim jacket since college, but i felt inspired this season. this pilcro jacket is perfect. a little distressed along the edges, tailored fit, and i love the cozy collar. looks expensive. fits really well.",4

75,44,Love it!,Searching for blazers that don't look stuffy? this one fits the bill! mine is at alterations right now getting the sleeves shortened. other than the long sleeves the fit is very nice. this will be a versatile addition to my wardrobe. can't wait to get it back from the seamstress so i can wear it!,0
75,44,Perfection!,"Cool, comfortable, goes with everything! i found both colors at my local antro today!! almost ordered the grey online because that's all that was available, but decided to check my store first. so glad i did. the peach is so pretty, and looks really good with my blond hair. the grey looked much more like a faded black, darker than pictured online, imo. i would have still purchased it in grey if that's all they had, because it is such a great piece, but the peach really is lovely. i'm 5'10"" 145 p",2

75,46,Nice jacket to add to my wardrobe,"I bought this in rose and i really like the jacket. the color is not rose but the picture is accurate. it is more terra cotta as previous reviewer's said. it is pretty casual but you can dress it up with a chunky necklace and dressy boots. i do wish it was a tad more fitted in the waist. i think it looks better buttoned, but i do wear it open as well.",3
75,46,,Love love love this jacket!! great spring and fall weather.. very stylish!!,0
75,46,,"This is a very pretty jacket. light weight and perfect for spring/fall. i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store. i did end up returning it though. it does run large, i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look! i was sad to have to send this one back! i was hoping to love it! someone smaller might love it!!",5
75,47,Adorable!,"I love this little jean jacket! i am petite and usually get a xxsp , but went for a size up. i'm glad i did. it fits a little snug. the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim. the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me. i love this - over maxi dresses, tanks, etc... adorable jacket - great buy!!",0

75,48,Very impressed!,"Received this jacket today and i am so very impressed with the details. initially when i ordered this jacket i first thought the navy blue waffle fabric was a corduroy or velvet, but it is a plain cotton blended fabric with unfinished edges that has the denim attached to it. the plus is the inside breast pocket that is trimmed so nicely and lined, and fits a nice sized phone. the inside is lined and even the sleeves are lined . there is pretty cream lace trim on the inside bottom of the lining i",1

75,50,And it has pockets!,"This jacket is very well made. the denim is quality and very soft. the other fabric isn't as heavy as the denim, but not so much that it feels like a mismatch when wearing it. i was surprised to find slash pockets by the side seams. on the interior, the slash pockets are sewn down and deep so that you can use them as pockets too. handy for your phone. fits true to size maybe a tiny bit on the generous side like a jean jacket should be. love it.",0
75,50,Great fall purchase!,"I can't wait for the first signs of fall so i can wear this! the fabric is a nice light weight and the fit is very flattering. as another interviewer commented, it can also be worn as a dress. well worth the investment!!",1

75,52,Polished look,Yes! i am 5' 120 lbs and busty. this hugs in the right places. there is no extra fabric so it doesn't appear overwhelming on me as even some petite blazers do. i had purchased the same brand blazer but in the mustard color and it did not fit well. this fits beautifully. the denim color is just like the picture. the sleeves are a tad long. so i just rolled them up - no bulk. i ordered a size 6 petite.,11
75,52,Soft and versatile,"I purchased a size small. i usually always buy a petite. but this fit me just fine since it is a vest. the length in the back didn't fall too long. it runs true to size. it's soft and i wear it with long dresses, rompers, short dresses, skirts. it's a nice tapered vest. i'm 34d and it's fine.",0

77,50,Comfortable as hoped,"I was looking for a top that would be comfortable as fall was approaching and this hit the mark! it isn't fitted but it doesn't look sloppy either. though it is comfy and is called a ""sweatshirt"" the fabric allowed me to pair it with a charcoal skirt. i am very pleased with this shirt and would highly recommend it as it can be worn casually with jeans or paired with a skirt.",0

80,31,Fabulous breezy top,"I was a little nervous to purchase this top as there were no previous reviews. but it intrigued me- especially with the sale price! i love it! i am 5' 6"" and got the small. it hits just at/below my knee in the front and a few inches above my ankle in the back. it is perfect with a pair of skinny jeans or leggings. what makes it go from a frumpy tunic to a cute flowy top is the slits up the side. a beautiful touch! the neck is very high- almost a cross between a turtle neck and a hooded look. i l",1
80,31,Love this!,What a great piece. so unique and so cool and made with high quality textiles. i expect this to be in heavy rotation. can go super casual/luxe with leather joggers or upscale with nice jeans and some heels.,0
80,31,Not ideal,"Ordered this online in the pinkish color. the material is a little thin. as a busty, curvy lady this one just didn't sit right, ran a tad large, and looked boxy. if you have a thinner frame, may be a better look for you. detailing is nice.",0
80,31,Perfect summer basic,"I tried this on in the store on a whim. it is so flattering, soft, and pretty. i generally wear a size 12 and bought a l although the m might have fit, also: it's got plenty of room. the chiffon yoke is not particularly sheer and a nude bra strap is basically invisible, the jersey is adequately opaque so no camisole needed. my dimensions are about 40""  bust x 33"" waist.",0
80,31,Perfect summer top,"I love this top! it's the perfect lightweight top for summer and the details are so feminine and pretty. the fit is extremely flattering. the arm holes are not too large (i.e. do not have to worry about exposing bra). i think you can dress it up with heels, wear it casually with shorts, & also pairs perfectly with kimonos. i'm 5'4, 130 # and i took my usual retailer size in this, size small.",2
80,31,Unique item,"I didn't thoroughly read the description of this product, so when it arrived i was surprised to see the thread was sparkly. i tried it on and the neckline is absolutely beautiful and feminine. it looks like a masculine cut on the model, but it's actually a really beautiful neckline with flared flowing bottom to it.

my only complaint is that it looks a tad longer on the model then it is is real life. i'm 5'9"" and it shows most of my behind, unlike the length of the model where it seems more like",5
80,31,,"The cut of this shirt is lovely and well thought out, the opening for the arm are not too big like some other shirts. i liked the material and the melon/ salmon color which i ordered was more vibrant in person. this does run large so i wished i had ordered one size down.",0

80,32,Great!,"I know i'm going to get a lot of wear out of this t-shirt this summer. i have it in white, and it's not too see through, which is what i always worry about when i wear white shirts. it's basic but then it has lace on the shoulders that adds something extra. i love its drape--it's not too form fitting. on me (i'm 5'2), it tends to be a bit long, but i like it. the shirt being cotton means that it's super soft. as far as washing goes, best practice is to machine wash and hang to dry--i'm afraid of",6

80,32,Perfect basic tee!,"Got this in the white and it fits perfectly. just the right length and enough detail on the shoulders. i'm 5'6"" and 120 (usually an xxs or xs for tops) and the xs fits just right, not too loose not too tight. i like the style since it emphasizes my shoulders and balances nicely with cropped jeans (i'm pear shaped). material is slightly clingy but it adds to the drape nicely (wouldn't work well if it was fitted, but it's not).",4
80,32,Perfection,"I almost never take the time to write reviews but this shirt is amazing... it's a super soft, stretchy, substantial fabric that is incredibly flattering. it falls perfectly and is insanely comfortable. i am 5'5"" 120 lbs and usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops... i went with the xs and it is a perfect fit. love it so much i bought it in 4 colors... i am now completely broke but these shirts will be in constant rotation.",0

80,33,Great comfortable shirt,"I really love this shirt! i ordered the orange and am considering getting the other color too. it's very comfortable and cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. this shirt definitely runs large and i had to exchange the medium for a small. the looser cut makes it very easy for this to look like a maternity shirt, so i'd advise everyone to size down.",0
80,33,Great tank,"Bought this in the turquoise color and it is awesome. for those worried about it being see-through, i'm wearing a black bra and you can't see it. it's the perfect weight. super bummed that the green is sold out but may check in stores.",0
80,33,Linen tee,Fits really nicely and i'm picky about sleeves but these are just right. a little see through but i don't have to wear anything under it because the seams and piecing cover well. love the fit not too blousy in the waist and the assymetrical hem is nice.,2

80,33,Not for me...,"This vest is a really cute idea for layering, so i ordered my usual size medium. and while it fit, it just added about 5-10 pounds onto my frame! ehhh the front just has this extra fabric that you are supposed to bunch up and then tie down, but it just made me look so bulky! sizing down wouldn't have helped as the back would have been squeezed in a small. it's a shame because it seems pretty well made and comfortable too. i'm 5'6"", 140, and usually wear a 6 or 8.",3
80,34,A slightly shimmery everyday pullover,"My retailer location only had the blue option, which i found to be very appealing and better in person for the following reasons:
__________
pros:
- lighter knit like others mentioned.
- the blue is a deep blue with threads of shimmery black that give it a more elegant touch while still being casual. i didn't see the grey, so i cannot compare the two differences, but i found the blue color lovely.
- this looks much better in person!
- it sat well on my tall frame of 5'9"", 36 c, wide hips, and hour",6
80,34,Beautiful pleating adds a touch of elegance,"For my 5'9"", 36 c bust, hourglass frame, and 170 lbs, i got the medium and found it fit well. a bit snug but i didn't want to go to large and have it too loose at the top. my thoughts below:
__________
pros:
- lots of stretch and comfortable due to being part modal.
- the pleating on either side on the shoulders just drapes so lovely with the cowlneck. it just gives it an edgy look that i really like.
- this ""grey"" has actually a minuscule houndstooth-like or checkboard-like appearance that's ha",6

80,34,Great fall top!,"I bought this top to wear this fall, and it does not disappoint. it's a heavier light knit and the pattern is subtle but really pretty. i ordered a size smaller than i usually wear so that i can wear it on or off the shoulder, making this great for work.",1
80,34,Love it!!,"This is a gorgeous top. it is a very soft fabric that drapes beautifully. i purchased the red print - i tried both on in the store. the red really pops. i've only
owed this top for a week and i've received many compliments on it.",0

80,34,Perfect long sleeve tee!,"I've been looking for a staple long-sleeve tee for a while now, and i think i've found it! i bought this tee in my usual retailer size of medium and the fit is perfect. the material is soft, the cut highlights an hourglass figure without clinging in the wrong places. the sleeves are long enough, which can sometimes be a problem for me. the length is perfect to wear with leggings without being too long. i'll be back for more colors!",0

80,35,Cute comfy casual,"I saw this online and immediately purchased the top in gray. it's so easy and casual but the shoulder detailing give it something different and unique for a regular gray shirt. the fit is loose and comfortable but not overly big, just right. i can't wait to pair it with my new white jeans for summer!",0

80,35,I love this shirt,"I really love this lace-up shirt, but i only liked it in black on me. i like it open like the model is wearing it, but i had to have it a little more closed because the lace part does go down a ways-and i felt like i was revealing a little too much. i would likely wear it open, but then have to pair it with a cami underneath to feel comfortable. i absolutely love the whole outfit as-pictured, and also reviewed the polka dot pants. i wish the laces were a little longer than they are-if you have i",14

80,35,Thick material,"I really like this top, it is form fitting and i think true to size that i would normally wear. i do not think the v-neck is too low so that i would feel comfortable wearing this even to work. i was surprised at how thick the fabric was, but i am typically cold so i like this feature. the criss-cross design in the front and back of this garment is very flattering and i get a lot of compliments whenever i wear this piece.",4

80,39,Nice detail,This top turned out to be better than expected! i'm a large girl and the length is enough to cover my hips and the shirt it not tight at all. the embroidery details are lovely too. i bought this for a trip to italy this summer because it is cotton and because i consider it to be a classic piece being that it is black and white. one nice feature is this top does not have to be worn off shoulder. it looks just great with the sleeves up.,37

80,41,Cute shirt but the sewing is slightly off,"This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine, while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.",6

80,42,Great sale purchase,"I bought this shirt yesterday for 30% off the sale price. i usually wear a m. the store only had s and i didn't want to pay for shipping, so i bought the smaller size. it was loose through the body, tight in the arms. you could size down if you need to. but if you have large arms, i would get your normal size or get one larger. the arm fabric does not have much give. the shirt dips low in the front and back, so it has ample coverage for your mid section. it also would accommodate just about any",0

80,42,Pretty embroidery- beading but poor shape,"Very disappointed when i received this. the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful. beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that. first it is nearly a crop top. second, it is boxy and it's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky. third, need to size down 2 sizes. had to return this.",0
80,42,Stylish & unique long sleeve t,I was surprised i was the 1st to review this t- i got it on black friday & loved the fit and look immediately! i wear w skinny jeans and boots but also converse or ... many options and a good price!,29
80,42,"Super nice, can use as is or layer it","All the colors are beautiful, the white is a true white. i got the gray one. it runs large, so i would recommend sizing down, unless you plan on layering using thicker fabrics underneath.",0
80,42,The perfect long sleeve t-shirt,"This shirt is amazing! it's an excellent heavier weight quality t-shirt, but so comfortable. if you are looking for the perfect shirt to pair with your leggings and boots this fall/winter/spring, this is it! i am 5'8"" 136 lbs and this perfectly covers my rump and the small fit perfectly. the band around the wrist is a nice touch, making this a higher quality tee. i am buying more colors.",0
80,42,Wash carefull,I love this shirt. i wore it once and it is so cute on - the problem came from washing. i washed once and made sure i washed on gentle. i took it out of the washer and hung it to dry and noticed that there was now a tiny hole in the body of the shirt. i am planning to exchange this and hoping it doesn't happen again!,0
80,42,Werid cut!!!,"I was really excited to see what this looked like in person. when i unpacked this shirt i was shocked to see what how short it looked. the colors are very close to what you see online but the shirt is super boxy. i have a smaller torso and it barely came to below my waist. you can't tell by the picture but this shirt can fit at least 2 people in the width. when i tried it on, it didn't look as boxy but still a really weird cut! it was disappointing because it looks so cute online! i will be retu",5
80,42,,I need one in every color. so super soft.,1
80,43,Love this shirt!,"I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on, i promptly went online and ordered two more! i've gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them. great for looking put together with no fuss. 
people that have commented there's were destroyed in the wash didn't read the care label which says dry clean.",0
80,43,Lovely summer top!,,0
80,43,New go to tee,Not tissue thin like most tees and easily can be dressed up to wear to work in a casual setting. i find myself reaching for this tee weekly! have every color! i usually avoid stripes however this tee seems to flatter and slim! love!,0
80,43,So bummed,"I so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good. i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful color....but......the fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips. first the fit, the arm pits are low and don't actually tuck into where your armpits are, so you have this weird restriction in arm movement. then the design is not great either (and others mentioned this), the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi",1
80,43,Too sheer!,This blouse has a very cute style. the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer? there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami. it also felt slightly on the small size - almost too tight for my normal size.,6
80,43,,"So beautiful! fabric hangs great, lovely detail, fits well and feels great",0
80,44,Cute & comfy,"Really cute top, comfy, with just enough flare that it can be dressed up a bit, or worn just casual. not clingy at all...in fact, maybe just a tad too flowy around the middle, but not so much that it kept me from going back to buy it immediately in a second color! i typically wear a large, but suspect the arms on the medium might be a tad small if i sized down.",0
80,44,Flattering top,"This is a very flattering top. i'm pretty flat-chested & this top doesn't look too bad. i love the subtle peplum - it makes it a bit dressy. i'm 5'4"", 112 lbs & got the xs.",0
80,44,Fun top,"I got the purple version in a xs. i purchased it on sale so it was a great deal. i usually don't wear large prints but i loved the print and the ruffle detail. very feminine. it also hides the tummy roll, so that is always a plus! i've worn it a few times and threads are already unraveling, but easy fix.",0
80,44,Great top,Love this top. looks much better on than the hanger. the color and fabric are very nice.,0
80,44,I beautiful and feels good,"Love the fabric on this. so many retailer tops sit unworn in my closet because they are sheer and i have to wear a layer underneath. this will not be one of those. the fabric is beautifully embroidered and thick enough that it doesn't feel too delicate. the back is a super soft jersey....feel wonderful! will go nicely with jeans & flats for me! as a super bonus, i bought it with my birthday discount and now have in in time for a downton abby party. :) i'll be so pretty!",2
80,44,Love this!,,2
80,44,Odd neckline,"I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5"" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny.",0
80,44,Pattern not attractive in person,"I ordered this online and was surprised to see yellow in the pattern when it arrived. i can't see that in the online photo. i didn't like the pattern at all when i saw it for real. the shirt is very loose, fits much like the model photo (i ordered a small, 5'6 140lbs). just looks kind of frumpy and the pleat down the front makes the front hang heavily.",11
80,44,Simple perfection,"This is the perfect simple tank for summer. not clingy, and hangs really nicely, but not so billowy that you can't layer a nice wrap or cardigan over it. fabric feels like a great quality. i got it in white, and it's a bit sheer, but i typically layer my tanks anyway. tempted to get this in every color!",1
80,44,Size down,"I was unsure about the color when i got it in the mail but it is very flattering. it is roomy for sure. with a pair of slim shorts or pants it looks great though. creasing may be an issue. 5ft 6, 135 lbs 36 d...the xs looks good with room to spare.

80,44,,"This is a great shirt that goes with everything. it's super sexy and i have to say....the girls look great in it! i bought the black first and went back for the green. the quality of the shirt is great...not cheap and no smell, at least not in my experience,  like was mentioned by another reviewer. i can't say enough about how cute this shirt is!",6
80,45,Beautiful top!,This top is exactly as pictured and the fit is perfect. the knit is a nice quality and the embroidery is striking. i can't wait to wear it. it will look great with skinny jeans.,1
80,45,Classic top,The top looks exactly as pictured and i liked the fabric. the fit is classic and i will be able to wear this top many different ways. i was hoping that it was long sleeve but it is actually 3/4 sleeve.,0
80,45,Cute & very full,"Cute top. agree with other reviewer that it is really nice in person. the colors are rich and the embroidery is beautiful. it is a very full swing top, but be aware that the sides are a few inches shorter than the front and back. this isn't evident in the photo shown. i usually wear a sm in retailer tops, and the small looks larger on me than how it fits on the model, in fullness and especially in the arms. it's still cute enough to keep, but i personally probably could have gone down a size.",6

80,46,Great fun top !,I just received this in the mail today and i love it! its adorable- very flattering and hides all the spots you'd want hidden. i don't find that this runs too large. i ordered my usual size large and it fits tts. it's not meant to fit snug. i ordered this in the navy color- beautiful and flattering!,2
80,46,On the fence,"This top is gorgeous, but the sleeves are all wrong. they're very tight for about 5"" at the bottom, right up to the elbow making it tight when i bend my arms. it's also loose in the armpit area, the bottom of the sleeve starts under my chest, and is styled that way, so i'm considering returning. i actually drove an hour to the nearest store to size up, but the sleeve feels even more tight. ugh! i love the quality & looks otherwise, and the front is double layered so no need to layer. the front i",0
80,46,Perfect summer to fall top,"I bought this in late august and have been wearing it ever since. i love that you can wear it either on or off-the-shoulder. the second option adds sexiness even though the top is flowy, comfortable, and easy to wear. on the shoulder i've even worn it to work on casual friday. the print is versatile, and i like that the fabric has a little heft while still being soft and drapey. i definitely recommend, especially since i notice it is now on sale!! it is generously sized, so i'd recommend erring",0

80,47,Very pretty on,,0
80,47,,"I purchased this top in the navy. the picture makes the top look like an interesting blue with some purple in it, but in person the top is just... navy. the lace and fabric are soft. it fits true to size; i almost always wear a small and the small fit fine. it wasn't quite my style, but it's a pretty top that will be great for spring and summer.",8
80,48,Cute top,"This top runs a little large. i should probably return for a smaller size but figure after i wash it, it'll shrink a bit. it's very flattering on and i really like the asymmetrical design. the only thing i don't like about it is that the fabric is a little itching without wearing a tank top underneath.",1
80,48,Go anywhere top,"This is a great ""go to"" top. it isn't too low, too tight, too dressy or too casual. i'm 5'1 and ordered a small petite. it fits perfectly, especially under the arms, (where tops always show my bra) & it doesn't go ""too"" low. i have to admit, i purchased the dusty rose color, i'm not sure how great it complements my olive skin, but i love it anyway.",0

80,48,Love,This is the most flattering shirt--love the fit and color!,0
80,48,Nice but 5% spandex makes it a bit clingy,"This top is much nicer than expected.....the fabric and style are great. i am a size small or medium, and got the small. from the front, it was great. not so much from the back for me. i'm larger on top than bottom and the 5% spandex made it too clingy around the dreaded bra fat area. i don't wear spanx. i wish retailer would be more specific with the fabric content. if i'd known it was 5% spandex, i would have ordered a size medium. i am thinking about doing this because the top is really",2
80,48,So feminine,"This is so pretty! it was beautiful in white but i bought the blue because the fabric is a little bit see through. i'm 5' 4"" and weigh about 135 and this shirt fit just like on the model in the picture. it was a nice neat loose. not sloppy at all.",1
80,48,Top of the season,"If all the tops i ordered from retailer this summer, this top is my fav. it is a crowd pleaser! my friend called it my ""art shirt."" the fabric is nice and the cut hangs nice on my 5 ft 5 170 pound frame. the armholes are a little big, so i just wear a red bra with it and it's great.",0
80,48,"Very cute, runs large","I like the casual, yet detailed look of this piece. it looks great with crops. the casual tie string makes the piece feel very laid back, but the details are so pretty. i have it in lavender. it looks way better in person. saw it at the store and grabbed it immediately.",0
80,48,Very impressed,"Love this top. purchased in a size medium, my typical retailer size and is very comfortable and lovely. wearing it under the pink peplum cardigan it was shown together with as well as wear it with jeans and other pants. i wish it came in different colors and other images as this a very well made top. purchased during the after christmas tag sale and love it even more. will be great in spring and summer, cooler days in summer.",1
80,48,Wish it worked,"I bought this top in lilac size s since other reviewers said it has a lot of fabric. the color and the quality were great -- loved that it had the lining underneath. if your bust is bigger than an a cup, beware. the top basically flared out from the farthest point on my bust and the fabric below just hung there. it was a pregnancy look. perhaps that's why the model has her arms crossed in front -- to give the illusion that it tapers in below the ribs, but it does not. unfortunately, this one is",0

80,49,Cute top,"This is a cute top and i did not even need my usual petite size thanks to the 3/4 length sleeves. i liked the semi-abstract sailboat pattern and the style is comfortable to wear. however, the tie at the neckline didn't appeal to me so ultimately i did not buy it.",0

80,50,Comfy & classy,"Love this top! love that it ia jersey knit which makes it comfortable. love the print which makes it stand out. love the design of a side bow. i did not have an issue with the banded hem, in fact i like how it makes the top more structured.",0
80,50,Cute top,"The lining is shorter than the top, so i keep pulling it down. also the finishing of the edges looks like a child cut it with some scissors. it is not evenly cut. i do like the color and style of the shirt, just not the quality.",1
80,50,I wear the top backwards!,"I bought this top in all colors as i love it so much! it is lightweight and perfect for our hot/humid summers. i actually wear the top backwards because the front of the top is longer that the back. to me it looked stranger to have it longer in the front! size wise, i think this top runs pretty large. i am usually a medium in most tops, sometimes a small, and i purchased this in a small petite. it fits great. i even tried on the xs petite and while it still fit in armpits and chest, it was just",5
80,50,Trendy,The tie neck is super on trend. this will go great under a jacket or cardi. it's a keeper.,0
80,51,Beautiful summer top,I am very pleased with this purchase. a nude colored racer back bra works perfectly under it and does not show through.   i have worn this with jean shorts and linen pants and it looks great with both. it is slightly on the dressy side so i also plan to wear it to work  paired with a skirt or dress pants and a cardigan.   i am a 34a  and size small  fits nicely.,1
80,51,Better than the photo,"I actually love the thickness of the cotton fabric on this top. i am tired of too thin shirts that develop holes right away. i love the color too.i am usually a medium and the medium fits well, if a little roomy.",2
80,51,Soft and romantic,"Love, love, this top! it's flattering (shows off your shoulders) soft and has delicate embroidery. i typically order a xxsp in antro tops as i'm very petite but decided to order both xxsp and xxs, just to see the difference. the xxs worked better as the xxsp was too short in length and kind of looked like i was trying to fit into a child size top. the xxs is a perfect length. it's my new favorite and i can see keeping this in my wardrobe for a long, long, time.",2
80,51,Tts apart from snug arms,"Bought this in cream in my usual xs/0, (5'7"", 32b, 115lbs). it is a very flattering summer weight cardi which will work well with jeans and maxi dresses this summer. i would point out however that the sleeves are very snug - if you don't have thin arms then you may have to consider sizing up. i stuck with the xs even though i had to carefully pull the arms on because the s was just a little looser in the back. the sleeves are meant to be form fitting but i think they have been designed a little",7

80,52,"Casual, comfortable, but not sloppy tee","Sizing: i'm have broad shoulders/back, 36c (34d), short waist, and i usually wear a m in a knit top. that's what i bought, so i'd say that this tee is tts. it is a little longer in the back than front, but not as a high/low top would be. rather, it's sort of tunic-like in style. i have worn it over leggings with and without a sweater, and the added length covers me. i admit that i'm a tad on the short side at 5'2"", and that i have no hips (straight up and down) and no waist. my shape is an upsid",7
80,52,Flirty,This was a nice surprise because it's a thick sweatshirt type of fabric. don't be deterred! it is nothing like a sweatshirt. it's comfy like a sweatshirt though. i'm 5 feet tall 120 pounds. i ordered my usual size petite small and it fit perfectly. what little height i have is in my torso. i didn't find that the top was short at all. it's without a doubt tts. order your usual size. if you have a tummy or bootie this top is the ticket! the description on the fabric details that the other reviews,10

80,53,Perfect for summer,"I ordered this in the blue motif and the print is really fun. the orange is even brighter in person. at 5'8"" 130 lbs the small has more than enough room and is a bit longer than some of the other offerings lately.",0
80,53,"Pretty, soft, sheer","Got this in wine, very pretty and soft. but so sheer, even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami. returning for this reason. having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra-comfort.",0
80,53,,"Great little spring top. the fabric is soft and the drape is of the fabric is just right. it is very loose without making it look like a maternity top and the length hits me right at the top of the hipbone. for reference i am in my 50's, 5'1"" and weigh in the150's. i normally wear medium size and this one was no exception. the blue is a beautiful cobalt color.",14

80,54,Interesting design,"The concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric. i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame. although i appreciate the design, it did not work for me.",3
80,54,Love this top!,"Totally my style, i love how it hangs and is so soft and comfy. material is thin enough to be fairly lightweight, and i was worried about it being clingy -- so happy it's not! body skimming and very flattering for full bust (v-neck helps here) if like me you don't like tight chested clothing. also love the length of this top. i'm 5'4"" and 36ddd, size l fits me just how i like it.",3
80,54,,"I have several of these tanks from last year and bought new colors this year. i have found the fit to be easy and relaxed, but not baggy. they are very flattering. i wear them thru the fall and winter as layering pieces under sweaters and flannel shirts as well. i was them in cold water, delicate cycle, hang to dry and they are good to go. they have held up well - even the ones that are 2+ years old are still going strong with no holes or tears.",0

80,56,Fun yet not too casual,One of the sales women was wearing this today. she looked amazing. then i tried on. i looked really great. the gray pattern is much more distinctive in person. it is comfy - 97% cotton. the unique hem adds punch. able to dress up or down. i'm a true size 6. small fits perfectly. medium was very loose and oversized. well constructed. feels more like a $98 ($78 retail) pullover. highly recommend.,16
80,56,Not kind to curves,"Wanted to love this top, and could imagine lots of outfits with it. the wide shoulders made my arms/shoulders look big. the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place, accentuating my belly. it did arrive very wrinkled, although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment. maybe that made the look worse. overall i felt that it made me look 15 lbs heavier than i am, so back it goes. i am 5'7"", 160lbs, 34dddd, and the size large was the correct size.",7

80,58,Perfect top,"This top has the thickness and comfort of a sweatshirt, with artistic flair and a figure flattering, unique cut. it works very well on me as i'm a petite large. i only wish it was a little roomier, or that i was 10 lbs lighter, but it's stretchy and i really love wearing it. the color is a rich indigo with a slightly worn look which adds texture and dimension.",4

80,58,,"More of a blouse than a tee because of the fabric which has a linen feel to it, on the front, the back of the top is more of a tee shirt material. not a travel top as it would wrinkle. the pattern and colors are the same as pictured. the sizing is large - i ordered an xs; my size is usually a small. it is a generous fit and boxy, not shaped at all. the back has a horizontal stitch band about half way down which provides a loose blouson effect.the back (which is all black and is tee shirt fabric)",14

80,62,Itchy and odd fit,"I was so bummed when this came in...the colors and print are beautiful, but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic/ruffle combo. there is also a liner which is a nice touch, but it's significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts. definitely going back.",3
80,62,Love this,I'm obsessed with this top. i actually love that the sides are a bit higher than the front and back. i feel like that gives it shape. i bought jeans similar to the pic here and they look so good together. love!,8
80,62,Loved so much i bought both!,"Immediately loved this when i saw it online and even more in person. i'm only 5'1' so i tried the petite sizing first but ended up buying the regular in an xs for the slightly longer length. the regular fit me like the model in length and i probably could have taken the xxs except the sleeves were too narrow in that size. i like that the cuffs are long so if you have to turn it up (like i do) it doesn't look weird. also, i found the fit flattering at the hips, following my hourglass shape withou",11

80,64,"Cute top, but not worth full price","I'm a bit disappointed in this top. i'm keeping because retailer's shipping rates are obnoxious and i don't have a store near me. by the time i pay for shipping both ways, i could have paid for 1/2 the shirt. the loft has some very similar tops for about 1/2 the price. i love meadow rue, and their material is fabulous, but the design is off on this one. you can't size down because the armholes and top are fitted, but the bottom is a tent. not my usual style, as i'm short, with a short waist. this",11

80,65,Loved it and wanted it but...,No size fit me. i'm normally a s to m. the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow. perhaps in length. so i ended up without it sadly. it's really a very nice top and great quality. i was unhappy to leave it behind.,0
80,65,,"This top was originally way overpriced. so i ordered it on sale for half price. still overpriced. it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed. the quality is not great. it is like a jersey type material. doesn't look like the photograph at all. i like the color, but frankly, that's about it.",4

80,66,Darling!,"I can't wait for our warmer weather to arrive here in minnesota so i can wear this lovely tank top. the style is so flattering, it doesn't bag out to make you look pregnant. the back yoke is solid navy blue chiffon which is a nice touch. soft fabric, drapes beautifully. the armholes are not oversized. the fabric is opaque so no camisole required.

i am 5'5"" and 120 lbs. and 36a. i purchased size small.",2
80,66,Great fit,True to size so great fit from top to bottom. i am 5'5'' and it hits my hips at just the right spot - not too high or too low. it also does not flare out too much so it will not give off the impression that you have something to hide in the tummy area. it is very soft and comfortable. the material is not fragile so it should be easy to maintain its shape after washing.,5
80,66,"Great, versatile t-shirt","I love this top. it has a relaxed fit without being frumpy, and it looks great with boyfriend jeans or skinny jeans and boots. it's a great, soft fabric that doesn't require a cami underneath. wish there were other colors.",1
80,67,"Beautiful top, wrong execution","This is such a beautiful top with pretty, vivid colors and soft fabric but the execution is wrong. the front is fine, the smocked upper portion is very flattering but then you turn around and the back fits like a cape. there is a ton of fabric especially in the upper portion of the shoulders and upper back, with pleats that begin under the ruffled neck and billow out. i got an xxsp (5'  103 lbs) so couldn't size down. please retailer no more billowy tops!!
so sad to have to return this one.",0
80,67,Runs quite large,"The blouse is beautiful. the quality and design are spot on. but it runs quite large. i normally wear a small or an extra small depending on the cut. i ordered this in a small based on the way it seemed to fit the model. it's huge. i'm going to have to reorder in a smaller size, but i'm not sure if the xs or xxs will fit better. i'll probably drive to my retailer store and try it on in person. for comparison, i am 116 pounds, 36-26-36.,",3

i ordered all 3 colors, and they just arrived........love love love !!!
they are soft, comfortable and a have a very flattering casual fit.
the understated ruffled details add the special ""something"" that is so retailer.
they are sophisticated yet pretty.
the orange is more vibrant in person and is a beautiful shade.

81,28,Beautiful jumpsuit,"Absolutely love this jumpsuit. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits perfectly (i am typically an xs/00). when i read previous reviews i was quite excited to read that most people found it to be ""short waisted""-- the waist band actually hits my natural waist (just how it is pictured on the model), which never happens! great quality, thick fabric and the pleats in the front are beautiful. can't wait to wear it!",0

82,28,Unfortunate!!,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,1
82,30,"Fun, unique romper","I really love this piece. it's so different from anything else i own! the material has a lot of fine details to it that are hard to see in the photos. easy to dress up with a bit of jewelry and heels. the only downside is the upper body fit. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs with more of an hourglass shape. i did not fill out the top at all, although the shorts fit fine around my waist.",1

82,36,Perfect!,"After having my third child, i was looking for clothes to hide my tummy. i've always loved the comfort of a romper, but the typical cinched waist was never flattering on me. this romper does not disappoint. it hides areas i want hidden, but does so with style. i get numerous compliments whenever i wear this. i cannot say enough wonderful things about this piece!",1

82,50,Substantial material,"Very flattering on. i'm 5'4"" /145lbs and took a small. i love how substantial the fabric is and how slimming it looks on. the only weird thing for me is getting it on?you had to step thru the opening on top, there are no zippers, buttons and if you have larger hips or butt, it will be a challenge to get on. once on, it looks great and believe it or not, roomy.",2

83,30,Length is far too short,"I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length. another customer had a similar review, but i still took a chance that it would fit well. the sides of the shirt have slits, and because the shirt is too short, it shows the skin on my hips. the rest of the shirt fit fairly well, but i'll still need to return this top.",0

83,30,Love this top,"I sized up to a medium from a small and was glad i did. the top drapes nicely and the fabric is soft. 

5'7"" 140 lb 32 b, usually a small on top.",2
83,30,Not great for athletic frame,"I am 5' 7"" with an athletic build (small chest, small waist, muscular hips/thighs). this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am. i purchased a small, an extra small would be way too short. i could see how it works for fuller figured girls.",1
83,30,Shrunk like crazy!,"Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.",1
83,30,Simple and stylish,Chic and comfortable and looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i'm usually a small/medium and thought the medium had a better overall look - sleeves were just a little long. the detail on the sleeves is kind of like the inside of a sweatshirt and makes it look a little more polished than the average athleisure top.,1

83,31,Beware of care,"Let me start off by saying i never write reviews, but feel compelled to so that no one else gets swindled into buying this beautiful one-time wear piece. i absolutely fell in love with this shirt when i bought it in the fall in black... perfect basic to wear under my new draped open vest from retailer! and perfect fit! i'm long torso-ed and long armed and always have trouble with fit. this being kind of oversized was just loose enough and long enough i could actually feel comfortable wearing it wi",0
83,31,"Boring front, great back",This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.,0
83,31,Boxy,"I love the color block concept but this top was way too boxy. the shirt was pretty much square. and the top was super itchy, too. looks so cute online but no-go in person.",1
83,31,Fabulous and versatile,"This top is beautifully constructed, fits true to size i ordered a medium - the armholes are nicely cut - not too loose will be able to wear with a racer back bra, accommodates my larger bust 34dd.",0
83,31,Just okay,"The sleeve detail is cute and well done. the fabric is nice quality, but the body of the shirt really doesn't have any shape.",13
83,31,"Lovely, but...","This shirt is comfy, fits well, the color (pink or dusty rose) works well with most outfits, but the front hook is ill-placed and often visible. it could be tucked under better so as not to show, but it isn't and does show. i feel that i frequently need to fluff it up to hide the hook. otherwise, i like it, but i wouldn't have bought it unless it was on discount, which it was.",0
83,31,Shrinks! don't buy,"I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying, as per instructions on the tag, the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape, and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!",0
83,31,Wear it all the time,,10
83,31,,I like this shirt. it's quite lovely. i ordered it in mint. it's nice to have a dressy t-shirt.,0
83,31,,"It's a cute idea, but it's so low cut and the material is very thin. i was hoping to wear it as a cool, flowing summer top, but i'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it. i'm only keeping it because it was such a good price. also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten.",0
83,32,A great casual top,I love this top! it's perfect for casual outings like a picnic or a movie in summer. it's material is thick enough to feel sturdy but still is very lightweight for summer. it's a little baggy in the front so if that bothers you then i'd size down one size from your normal. i bought my usual size of xs and it seems to fit perfectly. i'm tempted to buy this in more colors.,1
83,32,Comfy and flattering,I love this shirt so much that i bought it in both colors. i purchased the xs regular which fit perfectly. the material is incredibly soft yet thick enough that i know it has some durability. the neckline is very flattering and comes up higher than most tees but not so high that it feels constricting. i also love that it is slightly tapered and comes in towards your waist at the sides and is slightly longer in the back. it's an absolute staple in my wardrobe now.,0
83,32,Great addition to my wardrobe!,"This is a great piece, you can do many things with it. i wore it to work and church :)",0
83,32,Just ok.,"I found the color to be a bit blah, and the sweater is chunky and is a tad too short for wear it lands. also, because of its ""chunkiness,"" it doesn't tuck in as nicely to a pair of jeans as it appears to on the model.",0
83,32,Just what i wanted,This top is exactly what i was expecting. super comfortable while still looking stylish. just covers your bum so you can wear it with leggings or jeans!,1
83,32,Love it!!,This is a great sweater. it's lightweight and very comfortable. i bought a medium but really could use a small. medium still worked well though.,0
83,32,My new favorite loungewear.,"I bought three -- in part, because they were on sale. i do not think that i will ever wear these without a sports bra though. they are too low in the front and on the sides for a regular bra and too thin to go bra-less. that said, they may look cute with some of the lacy-show-me bras that seem to be trendy right now. 

i am typically a small, and bought x-small. the drape is not that different in the two sizes, but the length of the straps was much less revealing in the smaller size.

83,32,New favorite shirt,,0
83,32,New favorite!,"Looove this so much. the color in person is a rich wine. the pintuck and button details are hard to see in the photo, but there are three buttons so you can chose to open a couple.",0
83,32,"Sexy, simple top","I love this top. i got a medium in black on sale. i am 5'8'' and 135lbs. the medium fits great. the medium is slightly loose on me through the tummy, which is nice - in my experience, it is not too constraining, contrary to other reviews. however, i think it depends on your body shape; i am a coke-bottle. this will be a wardrobe staple for day to day and going out; note, it is too low-cut for work wear. very happy with my purchase.",0
83,32,Super cute!,"Love, love, love!
this is true retailer! the color is lovely and it's so soft! i love the seams in the back and the overall ""raw seam"" style.",0
83,32,Very flattering!,This top looks even better in person! the fit is very flattering and the fabric is comfortable. i highly recommend it!,0
83,32,"Want to love it, poor quality","I love this shirt, in fact, i love all bordeaux tops from retailer. i followed the instructions to hand wash only and after it was wet and then lay flat to dry, it may fit a child. it is a belly top. i want to love this, but it shrunk so bad even with the hand wash only instructions.",14
83,32,,,0
83,33,Beautiful but has flaws,"This top is just as beautiful in person as online. however, it has two issues for me. 1. it is too short. this might work if you have a short torso, but it would forever show my stomach. 2. the fabric has way too much static cling. no matter what i tried, it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides. not attractive. in short, if you have a short torso and don't mind battling the static, this truly is a beautiful top.",1
83,33,Beautiful top,"Upon opening this top, i thought for sure it was going to be too s mall, but it stretches nicely and is gorgeous when on. it is a little thin, and you have to be careful that it's not too tight or you can see skin through the knots, but i love this shirt. i got the xs, which is my usual size. i could probably have used the s, but didn't want to pay for shipping to exchange it as i don't have a store anywhere near me and the xs was fine.",0
83,33,Cute and comfy,I purchased this shirt to wear postpartum so i could easily be comfortable but still cute. it will work well for the fall with some cute jeans and booties. i cannot wait to wear it....any day now!  great choice.,0
83,33,Great flattering blouse!,This blouse fits true to size. i carry alot of weight in my mid section and this blouse easily covers and hides my mid section where i'm not having to tug or pull down. i have this blouse in the olive green in xl and it fits perfect. i wore this on christmas with my family.,3
83,33,I wish!,"I really wanted to love this shirt. it looked so nice and cool for summer and i don't own anything purple. the color was really nice, very subtly feminine. i am a little too short for this style though. i am 5 ft. 1 inch, 105 lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide. the side slits came up a little too high for my liking, but i easily could've stitched those up a bit and they'd have been fine. i think this would look great on taller women, but on me it looked like a dumpy sack.",8
83,33,Love the length,One of my favorites for comfy cute this summer! the color is a beautiful berry color! also love the length... it feels a little longer than a typical top which i love! 5'9,0
83,33,Soft and cozy,"The model does not look as good in this shirt as it looks in real life. it is flowy, flattering, and elegant, not to mention warm and soft. i hope it holds up!",0
83,33,Super soft,"Mutliple layers of buttery softness. i bought the blue and it's true to size. it is soo soft, i could wear this to sleep. it drapes beautifully. highly recommend it. now i want to buy all the colors!",5
83,33,Thin and see through,"The wine color is beautiful, and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however, both fabrics are thin, and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so, if you are the quintessential tall and thin, and you don't mind showing your bra, go for it! otherwise, i suggest skipping this one.",23
83,33,Unique staple,"Fits true to size, soft material and unique look. the sleeves and overall cut of this shirt are flattering. i was worried it might look boxy or baggy but it didn't at all. the dark gray is a gorgeous color and can be dressed up or down. definitely going to be a staple in my closet.",0
83,33,,"My favorite shirt!!! i wear it when i don't want to be in the sun too long, it has breathable material in the armpit. i loved so much ordered in other colors. i wish they would make in more colors!",0
83,33,,Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!,0
83,34,A pop of color and style,"Pros:
- fits tts. i tried on a size m and it fit well for my 36c and hourglass frame.
- the cowl neck gives it a nice touch of class.
- love the pop of yellow. not too showy and yet cute and fun.
- fabric has a great feel and stretch to it. forgiving fit. 
- will go with many outfits.
-wore a nude bra and had no see-through issues.
______________
cons:
- does seem a tad delicate, easy to snag due to being a knit, but otherwise solid construction.
- unlined.

83,34,A turtleneck poncho top,"I have been looking for a soft turtleneck that can be my to-go piece in the cold weather. this fits the bill as far as the material goes. the material used is very soft and even though it seems light in weight, it is actually very warm and not see through at all. i like the feel of this top. it would be pretty accurate to say that it feels as if i am wearing a blanket around me. it is that comfy!!! however, the one detail about this top that i am unsure about is the cut. it is very boxy to the e",3

83,34,Almost but not quite,This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.,0
83,34,Dressed up tee,"This top wasn't an eye catcher off the bat but i love nothing more than a dressed up tee, so it's why it made it to the dressing room with me. it has elbow length sleeves, a slub texture, super soft, awesome texture and detail. the slight v-neck is perfect and the overall fit is great. i'm typically a lover of black but the wine color was gorgeous too so i took both into the fitting room with me (the other colors weren't available). surprisingly, the black was not even close to a favorite, but t",2

83,34,Great piece!,"I discovered this top folded on a shelf and loved the material and this brand so i decided to try it on... even though it's super hot right now in ar. i'm so glad i did and ended up finding the other color and buying both. i am 5'9"", 127#, 34b and long waisted. it is difficult to tell in the pictures how this top fits around the waist... it is snug fitting but the material is thicker so i feel like it's very flattering. i tried it on as a boat neck look, then saw online it was off the shoulder a",0
83,34,"Less than ""just okay""","I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on. i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame. it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger. i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color. ladies with hips or a booty, beware...this looked horrible on me! it clung to my butt and didn't hang nice and straight like it does in this picture. i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it",1
83,34,Love it,"I love this top. the fabric is soft and a silky lightweight - perfect for summer. i feel it runs a size large. i'm 5'4"", 130lbs, with broad shoulders. i usually wear a medium, but a small fit perfectly.",5
83,34,Lovely material and style,"I love this shirt except that the hook that keeps it close doesn't work a lot, outside of that i love it. i typically wear a small or extra small and with this shirt the extra small was perfect.",2

83,35,Cute top....but shrinks horribly!,"I bought this top and it ran huge, i had to get an extra small. well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly! like its so small now my 3 yr old could probably wear it! i'm so sad, i really liked this top....but for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable.",10
83,35,"Cute, but poorly made","I bought this top in two colors--i think it's a really cute, easy top to wear, but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality. i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming, which i'm sure will be a hole in no time. two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally, i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears.",4
83,35,Extra fabric in back adds a lot,"I got to try this on today and i really like it. the fabric is a normal t-shirt kind of fabric (i was hoping it would have been kind of special) and the v-neck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing. i would feel comfortable wearing it as-is outside of work, but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work. normally, i am not a huge fan of v-neck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks cami's these days are often made with a ""versatile"" v and",6
83,35,Fell short of expectations,"I had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be. it was tts (i'm 5""3 and usually wear a small). but the material was horribly scratchy. both the body of the top as well as the sleeves. and the design isn't all that flattering. it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life!",0
83,35,Good for workout,"This tank is really thin and airy without being too flowy. it was perfect for my soul cycle workout, and i am thinking about getting it in different colors for working out. i don't know that i'd normally wear this top on its own because it's very casual, but it's perfect as part of a workout or vacation outfit. i sized down one size to make sure that it wasn't too flowy, and it fit perfectly. i am 5'2"" and 130lbs., and a size xs fit perfectly.",0
83,35,Gorgeous sweater,"I love this sweater! it is very lightweight- the knit is a wider weave, so if you are cold natured be sure to layer and bring a jacket. the fit is great, it is very flattering on. the back is lined and has the gray fabric that shows past the sweater hemline which adds to the uniqueness. this could be dressed up or down- i paired with a white tee and dark jeans and flats but will wear it next with nice pants and maybe a white collared blouse. very happy with my purchase!",0

83,35,Great top,"Love this top, the flutter sleeves are really pretty and give the top a bit more pizzazz than just being a regular tee. it makes it easy to dress up or down. the length is great, not super long but not too short. i ordered a medium and it fits well, not tight and isn't baggy, the material allows it to float away from the body a bit and doesn't feel stretched over my belly :) or anything. nice silky weight.",28
83,35,Love this top,I love this top!!! i just had a baby and it is difficult to balance classy with comfortable with out looking sloppy. this top is perfect. it may run a tiny bit big but for the most part it is true to size. great for busty girls (36dd).,0

83,37,Love this top!,"I haven't taken this off since i got it. and since then, i've ordered two more colors. it's definitely sheer, but the blue isn't see-through, though i expect the lighter colors are. it is a distressed look, but super-soft, comfy, and perfect to wear over work out clothes or dressed up with jeans. really a nice summer top for hot days. i'm 5'4, 135 the and the xxs is perfect--drapey, but not baggy. very flattering straps too.",1
83,37,Neck tight,This is a very pretty color. loved the flow and the length of this top. however the neck hole seemed too small for the top. all the embroidering is at the neck and makes that part very stiff. going back,2
83,37,Perfect for a cool summer night,"Cute and comfortable top. very cute top that i will have to wait a few months to wear (until it is cooler out), but a great piece to pick up for a nice price! it is soft and comfortable with a generous amount of room, but not where you look too big. i ordered it in the blue, but really it is like a dark gray ? which does not bother me.",0

83,37,Runs large...until you wash it,"I bought 3 shirts in gold, black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.",0
83,37,Simple & structured,"I love this tank. i got it in the turquoise and just ordered the blue. this tank is indeed linen and does not wrinkle. it's fitted without being too tight. i have a somewhat shorter torso and narrow waist and athletic build and this looks great! i'm not a fan of flowy tops in general so thrilled to find this easy, casual piece. i ordered an xs but am usually either xs or s in retailer.",3

i'm an hourglass shape, and this loose style for shirts often tents out away from my chest, but this top drapes down nicely. however, loose shirts like this aren't my style, so i belt this at my waist, and it looks even better. the top flatters my broad shoulders (meaning that it doesn't make them look wider), and it hits below my hips (i'm 5'10""). i also appreciate that the armholes are small,",0

83,45,Stuck!,"I was so excited when i ordered this, i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it, there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something, i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it, not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am 'stuck'!!",1

83,46,Cute for fall,"This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well, nice print and it's comfortable. i tried this on in the store, but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it.",1
83,46,Double v,"Thin and soft. lays nicely... form-fitting, but with enough fabric to move around and scrunch up without looking tight. the double-v makes it shift downward so the cut in front is pretty low - i have to keep adjusting it so it doesn't show too much. not sure how it'll hold up after a couple washes because the fabric is so lightweight.",0
83,46,Horrible front closure,Gorgeous color! salmon not pink though! lovely soft drape fabric but the itty bity thread and hook in the center is awful! i am a size 2/4 d cup and ordered a small and the closure is not adequate at all! it looks terrible closed and is too revealing without a cami underneath. does not fit like the model!,0
83,46,Looks great on me,"I read the previous reviews, but decided to try it out since retailer was having 40% off sale items.
it looks very flattering on me, and great fit for my body type.
i would recommend.",0
83,46,Love the feminine details,"The lilac pic of this shirt doesn't do it justice......it is so darn cute on! the band around the waist really draws your eye in and makes your waist look really small.... love that!!! also, the pleated sleeves are just so feminine and pretty! the fabric is like a washed cotton.....very soft. i can see this being dressed up or made really casual.....i bought the green color and am going to wear it with a chunky turquoise necklace and pencil skirt!",23
83,46,Love this top!,"Just bought this and am in love with it. it's a really nice weight - light for spring. the drape-y fit is very flattering. it's longer in the back than in the front and has a nice swing to it. can't wait to wear it!

i tried on the tee in the lighter color and didn't care for it much - i liked the contrast of the black and silver stripes.",7
83,46,Purchased two - had problems with one.,"I purchased this top in the blue stripe and red. after washing the red top, it lost color in little spots and also has little holes along the seams. the blue washed fine. overall, it is a very cute top and great for summer.",0
83,46,Sandstripe vest,"As a beach cover-up this would be great, but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.",0
83,46,Tent-like but soft & comfortable,"I bought this in size xl. it is so much bigger than i expected. there are panels of material. it really is huge. not flattering at all. still, i kept it. the material is so soft & flowy. i've gotten good use wearing it around the house, doing chores, resting, etc. i wouldn't wear it out doing errands. but, around home, it's perfect for feeling cozy. such a strange cut. i don't know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy. i think many would enjoy wearing it at home.",0
83,46,Too much material,"Maternity like, and although the back is really cool, there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwear/pajama. returned.",0
83,46,"Very comfortable fabric, great color/details","I ordered the green/teal in size xl. the fit on me doesn't match the model. it looks looser on her. i think it runs small, at least in size xl. it still is a comfortable fit since the material has stretch. the pleat at the top helps the drape of the shirt. it's a beautiful color of green too. i think the v-neck is too low so i wear a tank underneath. this also helps with the transparent panels at the shoulders/back. my other dolan tops have held up well and retained their color through washing s",0
83,46,"Very soft material, color is different in person","I ordered a size xl. it's flowy so it could be running larger but since the fit in the shoulders/neck/sleeves matches the model, i think it's true-to-size for the design. it is so comfortable. i love the softness of the material. the problem for me is the color. on my monitor, it looks like a light ivory or white. but, the embroidered lace bib portion is a darker ivory shade that doesn't work for my complexion so i'll be returning mine. everything is well-made though, especially the vintage-styl",5
83,47,Great versatile top,"My friend and i both bought this in the ""white"" color in our usual sizes. the fabric is soft, the neckline is flattering and the drawstring is cute. hides a tummy beautifully. the store had the white and the green. the green color looks very different in person than it does online. in person, it is darker and more of a soft emerald green--not the pale green-gray pictured online.",15
83,47,Must buy!,"This top is spectacular. intense and color soaked. i got bleu. super stretchy and comfy. the twisty part hugs and emphasizes your curves...even size 34a like me. the v neck is not too wide and low cut. it is narrower, close fitting and attractive. the seam in the middle thorax is a tad strange but it needs to exist due to the twist design. overall this top is cute, long and let's say men and women of all ages will enjoy it. it will make you beautiful on the outside and inside. it is not my usual",0
83,47,Really elegant in person,"This top is my favorite spring item. the color is a soft petal, but it doesn't wash me out (i'm a sandy paleface), and the details make it special. the cut is a little wide (i sized down), but it's also forgiving and perfect with slim pants or a pencil skirt. it's really a find.",0

83,48,Cute flowy tunic,"I'm a tunic girl--have to admit that. for me this top is fab.  i love roomy, swingy tops and this is exactly that. as others have mentioned, it is quite roomy at the bottom, however the weight of the fabric is so light it lays very nicely.  i love how it fits in the arms. i hate when arms are too big. the sleeve fits snugly. for reference i am 5'5"" 140 lbs. the small fit perfectly. i have already worn several times to work. perfect in the a/c.",0
83,48,Floral delight,I purchased this in both colors the neutral and grey. i love them both but the grey is by far my fave. this is a nice soft beautiful tee. the burst of flowers are just adorable. i found these ran tts on me. cute little top and such a good deal at sale price.,0
83,48,Great color and style,"I bought this tee becasue of the color and brand (my favorite tees last summer were by bordeaux) and am so pleased. the color is great for a fall layering piece, and the fabric is so soft....amazing! it may be better for layering, the fabric is very thin.",0
83,48,Great style,"Love this tee, purchased the blue and white, i usually wear xs in many retailer items but opted for a medium in this tee so it would fit loose. works good not fitting too tight. i like it because it's a tee shirt but it's a little dressy, great for going out to dinner, etc...",0
83,48,Love this cardigan,"This is one of my favorite pieces. simple, classy, and cozy!",0
83,48,"Lovely, buttery-soft and oh-so flattering","I purchased the blue (a bluish gray), size medium.

the entire top, including the fluttery sleeves, drapes wonderfully and is sooo soft. i wish i could wear this top/this silhouette every day! it's versatile enough to do so, if only the other colors were flattering to my coloring. 

sleeves: i'm thrilled to find a shirt that fits/flatters my proportional curves and sports sleeves that don't grip my biceps. often, i must choose to fit my arms or fit my torso, unless i want the additional step",1
83,48,Not for me and the red is more pinkish,"I tried this on in the store in size xs regular in green and i was happy to see it covered my bra everywhere. but it was a little too long (i usually wear xspetite). so i ordered it in the bright red hoping it would be less orange than shown, which it was, but it was more pink and kind of hard to describe; maybe more salmon or coral... i went up from my usual size to spetite for fear that the armholes would've been too tight on xsp but they probably would've been fine and the spetite is a little",2
83,48,Not for the petite or large chested,"Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn't fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn't make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky, which i'm not. going back.",1
83,48,Wish it was made of cotton,"It reminds me of maternity clothes. soft, stretchy, shiny material. cut is flattering and drapes nicely. i only found one button to close front... looked awkward. nice long sleeves.
not for me but maybe for others. just ok.",0

83,49,Disappointed in quality,"Got this on sale in black and red, and have only worn the black. quality is poor, seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat. a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down. not worth full price.",2
83,49,Great top,So glad i purchased this top! it has great style and can be matched with just about everything. the material is very soft and it seems really durable.,1
83,49,Just ok,I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is off slightly. i ordered my regular size xs and the chest/shoulder area fits nice but the waist comes very tight and not flattering to wear unless style similar to the model with a tucked in look. nice color and decent quality fabric but not my favorite fit. going back to the store.,13
83,49,Love it but need a larger size,,2
83,49,Love this tee!,"I had my eye on this tee for awhile, and finally ordered the turquoise/navy in the small. as soon as i received it, i ordered it in the taupe/peach and am contemplating one more! i plan to layer it now and can't wait to wear it solo next spring and summer. the colors are gorgeous (although the taupe is more dark gray which i love), the material is very soft, stretchy and comfortable, but it's the very flattering cut that sold me. it hangs beautifully and doesn't cling to my middle but skims it p",0
83,49,Simple top,This is a comfortable tunic piece with ample rear coverage. it is lightweight and there is room to layer a thin tank top underneath.the ivory is a marled heather with ivory buttons. it is not anything special in terms of style but it will serve the purpose of being a casual separate for around the house or for a quick errand.,2
83,49,"Some things going for it, but overall miss for me.","The red detail at the shoulders is pretty, and i liked the contrast between the red and white. the fabric is soft and comfortable. it is a sweater knit fabric, more substantial than you might guess from photos. the sleeve ruffles were a little poofy for me, and combined with the loose fit it made me feel a little too girl-ish. this could work for you if you are looking for a peasant style blouse with a forgiving shape and nice details, but it wasn't quite right for me.",11
83,49,Versatile boatneck top,"I tried the red/salmon color on at the store. it's a very bright color, but a nice one. the top is form-fitting, with soft stretchy material. there are two small buttons at each shoulder. the sleeves are a good length. the boatneck shows a little bit of bra strap, but not too noticeable. the only thing i didn't care for was the somewhat synthetic look of the material. if you're between sizes, size up as it's a snug fit.",2
83,49,,"The green is terrific, and the pleat in the back makes the top flows nicely. great if you have some muffin top to hide (like me). and the details across the shoulders and back makes it more interesting than just a t. i'm concern about the quality of fabric. lately there's much rayon mix and they tend to pill or wear out and get holes after washing.",1

83,50,Nice t-shirt but odd sleeves,"I like the pattern on this shirt and the fit over all is pretty good. i wasn't sure if i liked the sleeves as they are very angled, much more so than i expected. still, the shirt is nice enough that i'm keeping it.",18
83,50,Poor quality,It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.,1
83,50,Really odd fit!,"This looked so odd on me! i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too. the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom. the top is really large, as to be unflattering. perhaps it's just that it doesn't work on someone who is petite, but this one is a return.",1
83,51,Beautiful color,"The color of this t is beautiful and the shimmer is understated. very thin fabric, but should be fine.",0
83,51,Beautiful pattern,"In person this pattern is vibrant and lovely. i usually wear an xl in tops but in flowy ones like these i can size down to a l, which i did. the nice thing about the cut is it minimizes a large bust while maintaining a nice shape. it is a bit long which lengthens the torso if you are short like me. the bib portion is almost quilted and very substantial. all in all, a great purchase.",1

83,51,Reminds me of the 1970's,"I think this is adorable and am so excited to have bought it. it is really flattering. i love how it hangs-- it's loose enough without being unflattering at all. it's a little retro. it feels really soft! i hope it holds up well.

83,52,Busty gals rejoice! stripes!,"I am busty and have a difficult time wearing stripes because they are not that flattering. the stripes on this top are narrow, and the material is thin which makes this great to wear under a jacket if you want to dress it up. i am 5 feet tall and ordered both the regular small and the ps because i wasn't sure which sleeves would be best on me (as far as the length goes.) if you want the sleeves to look like they do on the model order the petite if that's what you usually order. you can also get",0

83,53,Pretty...,"Probably should have returned this but it's just so pretty. i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it's extremely long. tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length? aside from that it is beautiful. the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues, gold, neutrals. hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt. great buy-i just wonder how i'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter'.",0
83,53,Stylish and comfortable,"I love this top. very comfortable fabric and it can be worn in multiple ways. it is tight on the bottom. i usually wear an xs (5'4"" and 120 lbs). had to exchange for a small. very flattering. liked it so much i ordered it in both colors.",1

83,54,Cute top,"I ordered the green and lilac. the pink color was not offered when i placed my order so that was not an option. i found that it ran true to size, but was a loose fit. the lilac color had white streaks from the the-dyed effect, but it looked like someone had spilled paint on the front in one area so i did not even try that one on. for now, i am keeping the green one, but it is a deeper green than pictured and also a looser fit than on the model. i do like that it is 100 percent cotton and very so",16

83,54,"Soft, feminine and flowey",I bought this in wine in both the small and medium. both fit but am keeping the medium since it drapes better and looks like the photo with longer length in body and sleeves. light material is a great weight since heavy sweaters can be too hot in heated offices. style can be dressed up or down for office or weekend. have ordered the blue and grey. only concern is how well the fabric will launder.,1

- it runs bigger- this is the only retailer sweater where the sleeves of a m are a little to long.

83,62,Basic top that does the trick,"This is a cute top that is very soft and comes in nice colors. it's body hugging, but not clingy. i'm 5'5"" 120 with square shoulders and a longer torso, and when i initially tried a small i thought it looked ok, but when i tried on the extra small it looked much better. the way the top is cut it fits a bit weird under the arms, as you can see in the photos, but it wasn't enough to keep me from picking up a few colors when it went on sale. i like wearing this under a jacket or cardigan with jeans",1
83,62,Gorgeous!,This top looks elegant with my stirrup pants and feels like heaven it is so soft. fitted at the neck and arms; loose and swingy at the trunk with a beautifully finished hem. the yarn is two-toned heather.,3
83,62,Practical and pretty,"Love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on, especially over dresses (but also anything). it drapes beautifully, and i love the button closure detail. it is definitely a thin, soft, light-weight knit, but i think that makes it practical for year-round use, much like other items by bordeaux.",0
83,62,Short and wide,"I desperately wanted this to work - it's a beautiful color and overall quality...it is just so short and wide (almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat). i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side, but on my 5'7"" frame and long torso it just didn't look right. few extra inches and this could have been awesome!",6
83,62,Snap neck pullover,"I love this top. i ordered it in a large thinking it would be a tight rib but it is not so i reordered it in a small. i am 5'7"" 145lbs 34g chest. the small fits perfectly and probably could have taken an xs. it is stretchy but fits wonderfully. i bought the black. i love how the neck snaps and adds a little pizzazz to a simple black turtle neck. i'm wearing it today with straight leg jeans and my leopard print ballet flats. i feel like audrey hepburn!! i will not be dry cleaning it. i will wash",4
83,63,Great tank,"Grabbed this tank on sale today in the green color. great tank. it is not thin like some other retailer tops. it actually is a double knit fabric which hides those imperfections we don't want anyone to see or worry about. 
the top runs a bit on the full side, so if you are in between sizes, i would go down one. this top is great to wear under any open sweater for the entire fall season. the green color is a jewel green so the top does not look summary at all.
it is extremely comfortable a",1
83,63,Perfect all seasons,"This cardigan is light weight and can be used for all seasons. additionally, you can wear it tied in the front or down for a cascade look. can be worn for the office or with jeans. love this little good for everything closet staple!",0
83,63,,This is my new favorite sweater. it is lightweight and drapey. very flattering. can be dressy or casual.,0

83,63,,,0
83,64,Cute and classy,"I ordered this tank, and was very pleased with the quality. each of the stripe colors has a different knit, adding an unusual and interesting look. it has a trim fit. i wear s and sometimes xs, but this fit perfectly in the s. i agree with the other reviewers that that armholes are the correct size- so nice not to worry about a bra showing in the armholes!",0
83,64,Easy tank and perfect price!,"This tank is an easy piece to add into your summer wardrobe and its amazingly affordable. i don't think the material is too think like the previous reviewer. i chose the petite size and it sits well at the chest and is a great length. not too long, but still able to front tuck. i bought two colors and am interested in all the rest!",3
83,64,So cute,"This top is adorable. normally wear small or xs but got xxs based on reviews, and glad i did. still really loose but so cute. would have preferred petite but sold out.",0
83,64,,"Loved the look, fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only, you have to be kidding?",36
83,64,,The top is adorable and i love it. however the pink is not pink but more of a very faded orange color. i was really hoping for pink but the shirt is a keeper.,6
83,65,Beautiful and snug,,1
83,65,Bordeaux for the win,"As per usual bordeaux is perfect with this cardigan. very soft, washes well. love it.",0
83,65,Love this tunic,"This tunic is wonderful, wash & wear - comfortable and classic - love the trim. 

many compliments on this top.",2
83,65,,Loved the fit. the size was true and it felt so soft on.,0
83,66,A step up!,"Very pleasantly surprised by this top! it's looser, but in a flowy not baggy way. i ordered the m. the
vee is just right on me, tasteful but just low enough. love the sleeve length
ordered thinking another black tee , but it's going to be well used,and great for evenings.",0
83,66,Beautiful,"This is such a beautiful top. i sized down from a large to medium and it fits but too long and full for my shape. also found the armholes too deep and revealing for my large bust. sadly, returning.",1
83,66,Cute top,"Nice top. armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman, i'm picky about that. the print is pretty and unusual. it just didn't look great on me. there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely. it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque. i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible. great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now, that i decided to return since summer is winding down. i do recommend.",2
83,66,"Loved it, but...","I fell in love with this cute top, however after reading reviews, i am going to return it. seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions. who wants to dry clean a tank top? not me, sadly. too bad. style was cute and color was awesome.",2
83,66,Sleeves a plus,If you are self conscious about your arms and want a tee that has style then this is the one. soft fabric with a flutter sleeve makes this top so flattering. i purchased the turquoise and will purchase other colors. it's flowy comfortable and a must have!,3
83,66,Too itchy,"I ordered the blue stripe and white in size large. i didn't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place, which is a good thing. and it looks okay worn on the shoulders. i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i couldn't wait to take it off, immediately. i tried them on again a second time, still hopeful, with the same outcome. sadly, returning.",0
83,66,Unique tee,Ditto on the oversized comments. am generally a large in tees and sized down to a petite large and probably could fit nicely in a petite medium. the stitching on the neck and front design are adorable. a bit long but great potential for layering to showcase the writing on the collar or cute design on the front.  think it's a keeper!,0
83,66,,Living a casual life style in key largo fl. i love a fitted t-shirt instead of a boxy shape. i'm 67 years and am very active and fit. love your store. classy,1
83,67,Pretty top,Ordered the nude color for my daughter. love the color and the style. it's a.comfortable looking top. i pressed it before giving it to her. seemed to wrinkle easily. that's why i gave it three stars. probably wrinkle less if it had some polyester in it.,0
83,68,Great purchase,I bought this tee for a light summer top as i love linen. this top does not disappoint. i bought my usual size xs and the length is good-slightly longer in back. i purchased the black and the grey. the grey will be great with jeans in any color and the black i can wear either dressed up or down. the quality seems good. great purchase!,0
83,68,Will never be the same after washing,Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.,0
83,70,Pretty tank,"The floral pattern on this tank tranforms it to a beautiful piece.  i usually tend to avoid top with full pattern because it tends to look busy, but not with this top.  i'm usually wear s/m with retailer brand depending with the design.  this tank has loose bottom section, so the s is tts for me.",0
83,70,Very retro,This top reminds me of something out of the 40's. it is super comfortable and just makes a very clean look,1
83,72,Odd fit,"I ordered this attractive top in my usual size and tried it on with great anticipation. it fit perfectly except across the shoulders, a problem i haven't encountered before. i've tried it on twice more (do i hope my shoulders will shrink?), only to see that it pulls across the top of the back as before. otherwise, it is so pretty and flattering that i'll be truly sad to send it back.",1
83,73,I live in these tanks!,"I'm a power-walker. i bought this tank in 3 colors and rotate through them. they're great for working out with a nice sports bra underneath. i also wear them with leggings. so cute! love the colors, the fit. yes, they're thin. i don't think they'll last for years and years, but with the sale price they are such a great deal.",0
83,74,Beautiful halter to show off shoulders!,,16
83,74,Lovely,"I am a fan of flutter sleeves, always have been. however, at 42 years old i sometimes feel as if i can't carry them off. not the case with this shirt. bordeaux has found a way to balance just sleeve with femininity and maturity. i'm a size 12 in jeans and tops. i ordered s large and it fit beautifully. very flattering.",3
83,77,Petite proportions way off,"Sizing is just getting unreasonable, and nothing fits unless it's a crew neck nowadays. this v-neckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model, but on my 5' 4"" 115 lb frame, the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim. additionally, the shirt looked like it shrunk in length, and wouldn't have covered a belt on my pants. it also did not match the product description and measured 22"" from the hps to hem. i'm unsure of how when pattern grading an i",2
83,82,Shirt is just okay,"Relaxed fit, soft and comfortable. interesting design but material is extremely thin. if i had purchased this at full price, i probably would have returned it. it seems more like a pajama top...",0
83,84,Wanted to love,"I wanted to love this top. the color is wonderful in the pink and the material is silky soft. it is huge though, i am a 34 dd and bought my usual small! i am going to exchange for an xs and am hoping it fits.",1
84,21,A little too big...,"This sweater is super cute and perfect for a fall day. however, i am 5&amp;#39;9&amp;quot; and ordered a small which was way too long in the arms (the sleeves came down to my fingers). wish there was an xs i could order because i do love it.",0
84,29,I want to love it!,"Just got this in the mail yesterday and i want so badly to love it but it's just a little too big and boxy. i'm 5'5"", 125lbs and ordered a small but i really wish i'd ordered the xs. not sure if i'll exchange or just return. seems high quality and the pattern is gorgeous. it's basically exactly what i'm looking for until i actually put it on and then it just kind of looks like i'm wearing my grandpa's old sweater.",2
84,41,Favorite new sweater,"Love this sweater! beautiful detail, thicker yarn and well made. sweater has more structure to it than i had anticipated, which makes it look more tailered while being soft and comfortable. hits my lower hip and i'm 5'6"". receive compliments every time i wear it.",0
84,46,,"This is a very sweet/soft sweater, however it runs very large and is very boxy! i would say at least size down 1-2 sizes! i wanted to love them but i had to send it back!!",1
84,56,,"Soft, slouchy, and comfortable.
what more could you ask for?",0
84,66,Soft,"I ordered my normal size large and am sadly returning because it's overly large and long on my frame. the slight dolman sleeves are too long and wide and better suited for longer arms than mine. love the pointelle sleeves. they add a soft feminine vibe. hard to tell from the photos, but the texture is almost fuzzy.  the gray color is beautiful and  its actually made from multi colored beige and gray that looks silver in the light. it doesn't itch or shed. i don't like it enough to try a smaller",0
85,24,Not so great,"Material is thin, with a fleece like feeling on the inside. hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material. the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward, shows way too much, would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath.",3
85,37,I really wanted to love this dress,,0
85,43,Sporty elegance,"I tried this dress on and convinced myself that i didn't need it. on another visit, i tried again and couldn't resist. it is amazingly comfortable and a great alternative to shorts/jeans/pants. you can dress it up a bit with sandals vs athletic shoes but the fabric does tend toward more festive picnic or outdoor concert vs wedding. i prefer wearing dresses so this is a wonderful addition.",1
85,65,Comfortable,"This dress is extremely comfortable. the dress is slightly loose under the armpits, but the other than that the overall fit is great. can be dressed up or down!",3
86,27,"Soft, lovely top","Very soft, cute design, great over leggings!",0
86,28,Super cute!,Fits nicely and made with high-quality material. it definitely makes you look very put together with some nice slacks for work. the scarf is a very nice detail and actually doesn&#39;t look like it is a part of the shirt. love!,0
86,29,Love!,,1
86,29,Oversized bag,"This sweater has the weirdest stitching, although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die...poor fit means poor sweater :)",0

86,31,Beautiful!,,0
86,32,Beautiful shirt,It turned out exactly as i'd hoped - very well made and very classy!,0
86,32,"Disappointed: runs small, arrived looking worn","I read the existing reviews, before purchasing, and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large. this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer. i figured by ordering a medium, i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater. this was not the case! the sweater is short, does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind (and i assume the model is taller than i...as models are usually tall). for reference, i am 5'6'', medium build",1
86,33,Beautiful sweater,"This sweater is absolutely gorgeous! the green is a lovely, rich shade and the material is wonderfully soft. i love the slightly slouchy fit, but it's far from looking shapeless. i bought my usual size small (5'8"", 140, straight athletic build, size 4/6) and i love it casually paired with boyfriend jeans and ankle boots or a little elevated with a skinny and heels.

i'm so happy to have tracked it down in our local store, i'd buy them all if there was more in stock!",1
86,33,"Wanted to love it, but just kinda like it","So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it, i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing, the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i'm a 36 dd and mostly a size l, so that's what i ordered. it wasn't snug, but it didn't have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look, so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too, but i could have rolle",6
86,33,,This thing sheds so much it's almost unuseable but i used an entire roll of sticky roller and got it to the point where i could wear it with only a glob of fuzz on my underwear not other people's couches. it's cute and fits well other than that. buy a sticky roller!,0
86,34,Not for skinny girls,"This is not even a dolman style sweater because it's loose fitting everywhere around the arm. the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist/forearm, but this is not the case with this sweater. it's super loose around the wrist area - i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve.",1
86,34,,Like the crossover design of this sweater. the v-neck is not low cut and can be worn without cami. sweater is thin but not find it to be see through although i always were tank tops under my shirts. did not find it to be itchy.,3
86,35,Very soft,,0
86,36,Strange dimensions,"It's beautiful, lovely quality, gorgeous bird. but the fit just doesn't work for me. i'm usually a medium, which is what i got, it's just too tight in the chest. for ref 36d. as is it already flares out some in the bottom so i'm not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately",3
86,36,,"This is a great sweater. i gave it four instead of five stars because it runs unusually wide and is a bit boxy. if you like your clothes a little big, this is the sweater for you!",0
86,37,Love.it,I thought the sweater was pricey until i saw it on me. this sweater is really flattering! i chose the grey colored one. i'm smaller on top and this sweater is perfect with the v neck cut out the fabric is also really soft.,1
86,38,Perfect fit..,"I ordered this shirt through the website hoping it would look like it did on the model, it does! very nice, thick fabric. fits true to size, no complaints at all.",0
86,38,Short,"This is a thick sweater. it is pretty, but has a short length.",1
86,39,Comfy and flattering,,1
86,39,Cute,"I love this tank, it is casual and comfortable, but has the little scarf attached to it, so sweet and styling. i tried on the xs regular, and would need petite, it was a bit long on me, but some people may prefer that. i also wonder about getting xxs only because it is a looser-fit tank. both colors are nice and neutral, good piece to add to a transition wardrobe. (115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist)",6
86,39,Missed the mark,"I think this will work well on very busty hourglass figures,or very petite frames; but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors. i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular, and my shoulders are broader than my hips (w/a 34b chest). i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops, and, had i kept this, i would have gone with the m.

this shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep (~1"" above my elbow) and made my arms look huge. fyi, the v neck is very de",37
86,39,,"This sweater fits differently than it looks on the model in the photo. it is more fitted, less bell sleeve. and the neck is less boat-neck on me. i am often between sizes at retailer, but in this one i got the larger size and it fits well. i love this sweater. i just wanted to mention that i think it fits differently than what it looks like in the pic.",6
86,41,Beautiful!,I found this at my local retailer. it is a beautiful unique sweater. it fits nicely a bit longer in the back and a tad loose on the bottom. i've gotten loads of compliments as it's truly special. i'm not sure why it's not sold out yet!,0
86,41,Warm and comfy,"36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottoms

very soft and warm sweater, the boucle body almost feels like comfy pajamas! lovely heathered pasted colors as well. i found the large to be too big - the sleeves fit fine as they are a tighter knit, but the body sagged oddly. medium was the best fit.",0
86,41,,"This sweater is very pretty. the pictures online do not show the intricate knitting and the lovely details or how delicate the yarn is. i bought the light orange color and i think it will transition nicely into spring. the shape is very figure flattering as well. overall, i am very happy with my purchase.",0
86,42,,"The sweater is prettier in person than online. great quality, tight knit, overall good purchase. however, it does run small. i would absolutely size up. i am a size 4 with a 34 c chest and i ordered a m and i would have been happy with a roomier l. i was going to return to my local store but they were sold out in the larger sizes.
i will keep it because it's gorgeous and i'll make do with the less relaxed fit, but it doesn't look on me like it does on the model.",5
86,43,Beautiful but not for those who are short waisted,"I saw the orange/tangerine colored version of this sweater and loved it. it looked beautiful on top. the chiffon material at the bottom of the sweater is a lovely detail. sadly, the bottom portion of the sweater made my hips look huge and i felt i looked pregnant. i weigh 111lbs. i am petite and small boned. i think it was because i am short waisted that this style did not suit me. i wish i could look good in this! it is absolutely exquisite in color and texture.",32
86,43,"Soft, beautiful sweater!",,0
86,44,Lovely sweater,,2
86,44,"Very nice, but it's not for tall girls?","I'm a petite girl, 5' and 100lbs. ordered regular size xs since others mentioned this being ""short"" or ""cropped"". this sweater is adorable, not itchy in my opinion, and the lenght is just right, not short, not long, however it may be a bit short for tall girls...still think it's worth a try.",3
86,46,Farm animal pullover,"Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic, but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling, ""get it off"" in the fitting room. bummer.",0

86,48,Pretty and lightweight.,Very pretty and a nice fit. lighter weight than i expected at this price but as long as it holds up i'll be happy.,4
86,49,Lovely modern design,"This is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person - a nice mix of modern and artistic, with just enough color and a flattering fit. my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day, especially at the neckline. if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin, i would recommend it for style and fit.",1
86,49,Returned,"The fit was not flattering at all, but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.",0
86,50,Super cozy,Wow great soft feels great but not too clingy. only thing keeping from 5 start is that it will pill some. the sleeves are not fuzzy so they don't pill but body will/does.,0
86,50,Very thin material. nice colors,"I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors, but when i took this off the rack to try one, you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought, insulting quality, for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.",5
86,51,Heavy look lightweight feel,"This sweater looks heavy online bit is a very thin sweater. it runs tts however if you like the short length then i'd size down. i'm 5'4, 120# 34d and the xs was perfect. the sweater didn't feel too scratchy but it's not a soft sweater. very feminine.",18
86,52,Perfect summer sweater,Bought this sweater as soon as i saw it. the knit ribs and the length help slim your lines. it is flattering even on my heavier mid section. the material is airy but not see through (yay!) i love that the deep v-neck with collar is not too deep for the office. i would buy another if another color becomes available. perfect spring to summer sweater,8

well made, very lightweight knit of 57% cotton, 43% polyester. the ribbing detail is very well thought out. there is bias",0
86,55,Beautiful design,"I really love the way this sweater fits. the only negative is that it fits rather tight on the shoulders?i have broad shoulders and the sweater fits fine when my arms are down but a little tight when i raise them. but the size small fit well everywhere else, so i'm keeping it. the orange color is pretty but kind of glows a bit, but wish i'd also gotten it in the blue-green. very pretty and feminine, great with pants or skirts. i'm usually a small or medium (often just for shoulders) but got this",0
86,55,Beautiful soft sweater,This green sweater is solo pretty . i wanted it from the moment i saw it. pretty layers on the bottom make it so unique!,0
86,55,,"Didn't like at all. itchy fabric, looked good on model but on on busty girl.",0
86,56,Easy flattery,"Flattering even for a 50+ year old body. the lavender is subtle and pretty (it's a blue-ish color) and the sweater skims the body nicely. i have a broad back and some delicate sweaters make me look unwieldy; this one is minimizing. sleeves are long, but not too much so. i usually wear an 8 and the m fits well.",5
86,57,Sweater not as shown in photo,"Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly, with beautiful detail and high quality material, but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn't look anything like the phot",17

86,60,Pretty but very thin,"This sweater is very pretty but the material is extremely thin. the blue was ok but the white is nearly see-through. the design is unique but unless it fits really well, the bottom hem where it criss-crosses can bunch out in a weird way. i got my usual s and it was rather loose, causing this to happen. i suggest you size down if you want it to look smooth like it does on the model.",0
86,60,"Quality, classy sweater!",,2
86,60,The most beautiful sweater!!!,"This is simply the most lovely, interesting, flattering sweater ever. i got the green which is a lovely minty color. couldn't be happier!",1
86,60,,I'm on the fence about this one. it is pretty,0
86,61,Order in multiples,"Trying the gray version on in the store, i found that the size of the armholes varied greatly within the same size. i am a 32c, 5'6"", 120 lbs. bought the size s. the top looks great with a faded denim skirt and is also appropriate for office environment. i also ordered the ivory in a s, but again, the armholes were so large that i had to return it. if you decide to try this top, order it in multiples of two sizes to find one that fits your arms.",0
86,62,Beautiful!,"I'm always nervous about length on ponchos, and this one was perfect (fit like the model and i am 5'7""). it is definitely a thin/semi-sheer knit, but it looks so classy and elegant with a black long sleeve under it and jeans. i love that this doesn't require dry cleaning and makes me look put-together for an easy day to night look. i'm 25 weeks pregnant and love that this works now and later :) very happy with this purchase!",2
86,62,Would have paid full price!,I love this sweater and don't think the pics do it justice. i ordered the light blue/lavender color and couldn't be happier. it's great with leggings or jeans and booties or boots. i received many compliments the one time i've worn it so far. so glad to have snagged this on sale but i wouldn't have hesitated to pay full price!,1
86,64,Gorgeous but delicate,"This is a beautiful piece - but not if you need a hardy sweater. the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw. but it is lightweight and delicate. i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly. i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness, i had to say no. i will watch for sale.",2
86,65,,,0
86,66,Underwhelmed,"I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side, so the garment flows nicely, it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial, heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey, not whi",0
86,68,Said no to camo,"Great dramatic cardigan, wearable art, and not for the meek. i'll wear with a leather skirt and boots, jeans and boots, or a dress and boots. if the lack of closure at top bothers you, attach something --be creative. i like the movement that alternately hides and reveals the statement jewelry worn.",3
87,29,Nice summer shorts,"These shorts were exactly as expected. they are nice thin shorts perfect for a hot summer in texas. i have just worn a few times out running errands in high 90 degree weather and they were perfect. i bought the grey and they are a nice change from jean shorts, but still match just about any top. i typically wear a size 0, but after reading the reviews purchased a size 2, so i would say they run a little small. they are slightly snug in the waist, but i ordered online and liked them enough to kee",2
87,35,,Cute everyday shorts. run tts to maybe just slightly small. not too short for this mid 30s mom.,5
87,39,Great shorts,These are a comfortable and fashionable pair of shorts!  they run true to size and look great!,0
87,40,,Love these shorts! fit true to size and the material is so amazing.,0
87,52,Cute but disappointing,"Beware. white is not white. white is more cream, off-white, light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute, but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer, but unfortunately, creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also, the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.",5
88,28,Beautiful fall skirt,I ordered the dark turquoise skirt and it fits perfectly! the materials is a very high quality corduroy and the color is beautiful. i really like the buttons on the front as well. gotta love warm skirts for colder climates!,0
88,30,,"Beautiful skirt with a fun, graphic pattern and embroidered texture. i tried on my usual xs as well as a s to compare. they both fit but i decided to keep the xs since the skirt has a little bit of a stretch thanks to a hidden elastic panel in the back, plus it looks best at your natural waist. i'm 5'2"" and often need to wear petite, but this skirt is already quite short so i bought the regular size. looks great bare-legged or with tights. love the pockets too!",0
88,31,Pretty but not perfect,"This is a thick jacquard fabric and the colors are stunning. this would be best for very thin petties or tall women. i'm 5'4"", 125#, 27/4, and it was just too much fabric so my waist looked thick. the length was great though. sad it didn't work out",5
88,39,Cute skirt,"The fabric was more ""southwestern"" looking when i got it than it looked in the pics. it fit a bit larger around the bottom than i like.",0
88,39,Great skirt,"My hips are very narrow and i don't have much of a waistline. in a-line skirts and anything that sits below the waist, i wear a size 6. skirts like this with a defined waist almost never work for me because of the waistline. if this is typically your style of skirt, i think it will run large because the waistline is more generous than usual. 

 i tried it on in the store today and bought it in a size 8. it's very comfortable and cute and will be easy to pair with different things.",0
88,43,Eh...,"This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big, but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together, almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple, and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!",6
88,44,Hurray for corduroy,"I saw this skirt at my local retailer store and thought it was just another corduroy skirt until i got up close and personal. it feels so soft yet there is structure to the skirt, hurray for a bit of spandex for movement. the first button is different from the rest of the buttons and i appreciate that type of details. only the wine color was available in the store and it is shown just like on the photo. the skirt falls right above my knees and size regular 4 fit me very well (i'm 5'2"", 26 waist, 3",4
88,47,Another winner!,Love this skirt!  i purchased the chino skirt during the summer and wore it weekly.  this skirt is the fall equivalent!  flattering and true to size!  there is some stretch to it so it's very comfortable.  highly recommend!,2
88,51,Great fall staple,"Great style and fit. i purchased the wine color, and i'm probably going to also get the other two. i typically wear a 10-12 in skirts, bought this in a 12 and it fits perfect. however, the fabric is super stretchy so a 10 may have been sufficient.",2
88,53,Lovely skirt,"I was hesitant to try this on because honestly, it looked so short. however, i just bought this at my retailer store and it is very flattering on! 1st of all, it runs big. my normal size (12) was way too big and i had to go down a size. i could have gone down 2 sizes but the length became problematic. in my regular size (that was too big), the skirt hit me a few inches above my knee. perfect! in the size smaller, it was a tad higher; wish it was the same longer length as the 12 but still acceptabl",5
88,58,Great skirt and yet....no pockets,"I bought this in the faded pink rose color (which is inexplicably called ""red motif"") and it is very comfortable yet not so stretchy as to fall off. i did size down from 12 to 10; there is a bit of puckering of the front placket but i believe, based on my history with pilcro, that there will be enough stretching out to even out that puckering. i wish there were pockets though i can see it may be a design decision. i love the faded inbetween color but the other colors are great and i can see gett",13
88,59,Nice fall piece,"I just tried it on and it fits well, with no extra room. it seems like a nice fall piece to have in your wardrobe. the color leans more towards green. now i have to figure out what to put on top when i wear it!
i think it will be cute with boots.",0
88,62,Great casual skirt,I almost never buy full price but i did with this skirt.  it is adorable! saw it in the store.  it is too short to wear to work but is fine for casual wear.  i am a size 14 but the largest one they had was a 12 and it fit perfectly.  i&#39;d size down. the fabric is stiff and the a-line stands out.  colors are southwesternish.  can be worn with any color top.  i bought a cream colored top to wear with it (that was on the sale rack) but i'm sure there are plenty things in the closet that will go.,0
88,63,Cute fall skirt,"Bought this skirt in the light plum color. nice soft corduroy fabric.
it fit well. not too short. 
will be cute this fall with a sweater and boots. 
my only complaint. i wish it had pockets.",1
88,64,A perfect skirt,"Similar to the previous reviewer, i'm also between sizes and for pencil skirts it's usually the larger size that end up fitting. whether this skirt runs large or maybe because it has a slight stretch, my smaller size (10) fits perfectly and seems comfortable enough to wear on a long flight or road trip. the fabric is wonderful, the skirt length is great for work, and the styling is really nice with added detail of buttoned loops at the waist. if i had one negative comment it would be an itty bit",7
88,79,Great fall/winter skirt,"Living in alaska means fall starts early and winter runs long. this great little skirt is perfect for casual fridays and weekends. i am 4'11 and ordered the petite 4, which is a little big around the waist, but could tuck a sweater or shirt in. absolutely love this skirt and thinking about purchasing in another color.",0
89,37,Beautiful top -- runs large!!,"I purchased this top in the xs and was so excited to receive it as i love the layered look snd the back of the sweater was so cute online! the sweater itself is lovely, but it was a tent on me! waaaaay too big for my 5'3"" frame. if you're a taller gal or someone who likes more volume in their swing tops, this is for you. unfortunately, i had to return it.",10
89,42,Pretty but size down!,"A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this, i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey, not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said, it's very pretty, i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder, and i'll give the xs a shot instead!",2
89,47,Fits like a giant tent,"The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs, but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body, it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.",4
89,66,Great drape!,,0
89,68,Beautiful fabric and detailing,"It's rare to find clothing made of quality fabrics, and this is a fine, soft wool blend. the design is feminine without being over-the-top, and the fit is slightly loose, as pictured on the model. i would not recommend wearing it with a belt, as pictured; it makes it look too ""trendy"" and detracts from the shape of the cardigan, which is beautiful on its own just skimming the body. it is a perfect topper and can work for daytime or an evening out. really lovely, and one of the few things i decid",0
90,25,Runs a bit large,"And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice, color pretty, not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....",0
90,26,Lumpy on the sides,"Usually wear s and xs, tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers, green on outside, and a polyester beige layer underneath.

but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.",1
90,29,Disappointing,"Ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off. i love the drape in the front, but it did not hit in the right place. the fabric was soft, but not as high end looking as i was expecting. i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look, but sadly this is going back.",0
90,31,Cute and quirky,"This is a cute and quirky feminine top with the ruffle detailing and polka dot flannel inside the sleeve cuffs. i wish it was little longer and maybe not flannel, then it would be perfect, but overall i liked it. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame (plus a relatively short torso) and the small fit throughout the shoulders and chest.",11
90,31,"Love style, not quality","The color of this top is lovely. however, i felt the quality was lacking for the price. the fabric is thin and the top i tried on in the store had some loose threads already. fit was tts for me.",3
90,32,Cute piece for fall,,0
90,33,Cute top,Great top for everyday wear. runs a little large as i usually for size medium and i bought a small. a tiny bit see through but i think i can get away without wearing a tank underneath.,0
90,35,Pretty,This top was a great purchase even though it's a bit expensive. love the colors and the fit.,0
90,35,So soft and cozy,"I love this for a casual winter day. the fabric is so soft. the draping gives it a unique look. so cozy and nice. it's a bit big, though. opt to size down.",0
90,36,Cute top,"Cute top, wish they had xxs. looks great with jeans and a fun necklace like pix. i got an xs (5'4 and 135 lbs) and it's still a little wider than i would prefer, but i'm not a skinny jeans gal so might look better with those. i decided to keep it since no xxs. wore all day with jeans for a more casual event, then added a skirt and high heels later for a theater show. super comfortable and looks great for all occasions.",2

90,37,"Beautiful, but not flattering","When i first saw this shirt online i was so excited! it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall! unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed. in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous. it's fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy. i love the navy/cream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well, and the buttons are cute too! when i put it on it was so comfortable, but it made me look like i was pregnant! especially from the side it just",0

90,38,Flowy and feminine,,1
90,38,Love!,"This top is so beautiful!  really well made with solid embroidery - not the thin lightweight type.  i thought it ran rather large but i don't have the bust to fill in the top area.  i'm usually a small in tops (sometimes medium due to my height 5'8"") but went down to an xs so the arm holes didn't show too much.  length was still great.  a steal at the sale price!",0
90,39,"Nice colors, warm, but a bit boxy","So i recommend wearing with something more fitted, or with a flare (jeans), or tucked in like the picture. i love the detail of hte polka dot on the sleeves and collar (inside), so if you leave the collar open or roll the sleeves up a bit, you see hte contrast.
it is a bit short, and i am petite, i ended up with regular size anyway otherwise, it may have been too short.

colors are nice, and i love the material, it is very soft and hoepfulyl warm (my orffice is freezing). should ahve grabbed it",1
90,39,,"I'm so excited that retailer is bringing back some of the gorgeous fabrics and details they used to have. the all over embroidary is beautiful, the cotton/silk blend is delicious, and there's enough shaping that the top doesn't look too boxy. i did end up sizing down for a slightly more fitted loo and for a smaller armhole. i also picked through a couple of tops to find the one i wanted, since the embroidery pattern wasn't centered on some of them.",0
90,40,A great pick for summer,"I'm normally a small in retailer tops, but i could tell that this would run big. i'm glad i sized down to an extra small. this top is flowy and airy without being baggy. the colors are summery and beautiful. my only complaint is that it's a bit sheer, and i can see the outline of my bra in front. i will have to wear a cami underneath.",1
90,40,,Love the feminine take on flannel and how it fits like a tailored shirt. i am a bit long waisted and the side slit reveals a little too much when i lift my arms. if the shirt was just a little longer it would be perfect.,0
90,42,"Did not like the fit, but beautiful colors","I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous, very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and, it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2"", 112lbs...with a small frame.",0
90,42,Great fall colors,This tops is super cute and great transitional shirt for the fall. a little short in the front but still a great shirt.,0
90,42,Perfect but...,"I love this top! it is a perfect summer staple but for me it was too short. i sized up to fix this problem because i prefer the boho, flowy look. it is flowy on it's own but i felt it lacked length so went up a size. waiting for my retailer mail with anticipation!",3
90,44,Go to pattern,"I?m mad for plaid but usually for smaller pattern and winter colors. somehow, this top was love at first sight. it looks simple but it?s not. it?s unique in its own way (look at the back, the slightly puffy sleeves, the side slit), and the colors are such a great mix that go with everything. the stylist opened up a couple of side buttons and tied the material to a knot, so cute. i purchased the xs and the fit is the same as shown online (i?m 5?2?, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i know the price seems",6
90,44,,"I love the overall design of the top. the embroidery is very nice as well. i would agree with the past reviews that it runs large. i am between a small and medium, so i ordered the small.",2
90,44,,"Tried and pictured the regular size small. my stats are 34/35a-28-36 and i usually wear a 6 or an 8 on top in shirts and blazers. the small here was nicely loose so it might run a bit big.
in person, the colors are dark navy on light beige.
lovely heavy weight cotton and stitching.
i think it's deliberately a bit short, hit at my hip (i'm 5'6"") but i like this.
the 3/4"" sleeves are a bit nowhere for me...i wish they were full length but that's my only quibble.",9
90,44,,,0
90,46,Cut does not flatter,"Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.
i will be returning it.",0
90,46,"Strange cut, pretty idea","I bought this in size xl and it ran small along the waist & bottom hemline. i'm pear-shaped so it's an awkward fit. i'll wear it tucked in or belted. they used a lot of material in the sleeves & through the top portion. i wish they hadn't made it such a narrow cut along the bottom.

the sleeves are very pretty. the embroidery they used for the cutouts is a little rough & scratchy. since i got it on sale & like the color, i'm keeping it. i recommend trying this on if you can.",2
90,46,Unfortunately didn't work in xl,"I ordered the xl and the colors are just as pictured. the material is so soft. the problems: too short and too small. i'm a little over 5 ft. 5 inches and this top ran so short on me. i wish there were three more inches of material and then it would have been great. it was cut a little tight along the shoulder line too. i was so disappointed that this couldn't work on me. i like a romantic style, especially for comfortable basics. but, this was a pass for me. i had to return it. the ruffles on t",3
90,46,,"I love this top! was not immediately in love with it when i saw it on line but when i saw it in store the other day and got to try it on i fell in love!! the colors at a little deeper in person, which i loved! it is a traditional soft flannel top! it is fitted and flattering! a must have for fall/winter!!",2
90,47,Beautiful!,This is a gorgeous buttondown. the colors are stunning - i love the mix of blue and brown. the fabric is super soft and drapes just right. i feel the this shirt runs true to size. i'm an xxs petite and it fit perfect. this one is a winner!,0

90,48,Flannel meets funky,"Love this top! a new take on traditional flannel. yes it is pricey for flannel, yes it is not thick like a traditional flannel shirt but it is feminine, sexy, comfortable....even my husband liked it on me. i ordered a regular small, wish i would've went for a petite x-small, however they are sold out. regardless i am keeping :-) for reference i am 5'3, 110-115 and the small is definitely roomy.",0
90,49,Runs large,Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!,4
90,51,Very pink,On my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink & very washed put pinks - looked awful on me as brunette. maybe will work for someone who likes pastels. overall style was also disappointing- just hung. this went back.,1
90,51,,Another beautiful mave piece!! that is too big!! waiting for the size down to come in the mail. fingers crossed this works. the large was too overwhelming on my 5'6 frame. the tank that comes with it is soft and comfy and the gold accents really make this an outstanding number!! too bad no petite is offered. i ordered the black but it was hard to choose because the white also looks amazing. i predict lots of cooing over this lovely!!,4

90,54,Cute summer blouse,"This top is really great for the summer. the fabric is light and gauzy so it's perfect for hot days. i don't like to wear a cami in the summer and this shirt does not require one when worn with a nude bra. i love the window pane pattern- and the light pink color is very flattering and subtle. i'm 5'5"", 124 lb. with fairly broad shoulders, and wear either a small or medium. i ordered the medium in this shirt and found it a bit large so the small would have worked as well. i would say that your re",1

90,54,"Cute, great quality, nice fit","Love this top so much. it's very unique and one of those tops that's ""effortless"" to wear. i was expecting it to be boxy because of what other reviewers had written, but i find it to be flattering and comfortable. i'm glad i ordered the small because i do think the medium (my usual size) would have been too big.",0
90,56,"Cute design, good quality but baggy & unflattering","Like a previous reviewer, i love white blouses -- nothing better. also love polka dots, so i grabbed this at my retailer store the minute i saw it without even trying it on. quality is good; nice material. maybe a little heavy for summer. but it really didn't work on me. i normally wear a small in tops, however with a 34d chest (5'5"" 122 lbs) i do sometimes get a bit of gapping with blouses at the chest. this does not gap but it just hangs on me. if it was a true peplum and fitted at the waist i t",4
90,57,Love this buttondown!,"Sorry, but i disagree with a previous reviewer who wrote that this buttondown is sheer and runs large. as for sizing, i purchased my usual size small. the fit is intended to be a bit slouchy, and it fits perfectly through the shoulders and the bust. love the high/low hemline, and the back isn't too tight across my bum. i'll also note that i'm 57 years of age and might tend to be a little more modest when it comes to sheer fabrics. the see-through factor is not an issue with this buttondown. i'm",13

90,60,Love the 3/4 sleeves,"This is all around, a pretty feminine take on the white shirt- very cute! the dot pattern adds some drama without it being too over-board. this fit of this top is fairly generous (on me at least), but it doesn't have a lot of stretch. i could probably be either a s or xs, but took the xs to get more of a silhouette.",5

93,62,In love!,"I sat on the fence almost too long on this piece and finally ordered one when it popped up as a return...so happy imwas able to snag it. it is incredible. i put it with my favorite closed jeans and chanel work boots and wow! i also have tried belting it where the fur begins and that looks equally fabulous. imput true to size as it is suppose to be roomy, to many people ruin styles by trying to get them to fit in a way they were not meant to...embrace the uniqueness of this piece and roder true t",0
93,63,,This sweater coat is very bulky and has an odd and unflattering shape when on.,1
94,18,"A little big, but so comfortable!","This shirt is incredibly comfortable. the material is so soft, and it fits so well. i am 5'6"" and 130 lbs with a 32b chest and i purchased a small - it is large on me, and i would have preferred an xs, but the small is just fine as well! it is a great shirt, especially for an oversized henley. 100% recommend. (one star off for the larger sizing.)",0
94,20,Just dreamy,Purchased in a small. usually a 4-6-8. i layered over a sleeveless dress and i felt amazing. great for those tighter dresses. the fabric is sheer but not super see through. the tassle in the back is so creative. it closes enough in the back to not look weird. i have so many plans for this piece. black is the perfect color too. the collar colors are perfect too.,1
94,23,Practical and cute,I purchased this shirt in blue and i like it. the fabric is more of a stretchy/jersey material - didn't expect that. but the shirt looks decent on and is comfortable.,0
94,24,Nice spring top,"I do a lot of online shopping and, consequently, a lot of returning. when i saw this shirt online i was really excited about it - it just looks very elegant, nice and airy. when the shirt arrived, i almost thought that i should return it, because there was blue lint all over the body and sleeves. turns out that this is part of the shirt; if you zoom in, you can see the blue specs woven in. i didn't end up returning the shirt, because it's extremely comfortable, and i still get a lot of complimen",0
94,24,Romantic ruffled tee,This ruffle tee is adorable on. the fabric is light but not thin and the styling is very flattering to any figure. i look forward to wearing it as a transition piece as it stays warm long into fall in the south.,1
94,25,Lovely but...,Really like this tee but i do wish it was made of another material. i like the design. simple with a nice macrame detail. the material is a very plain with much to be desired. ultimately kept the shirt but would have loved it more if it was made with something that felt better quality.,0
94,25,No!!,"I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style, but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded, and the trim of the shirt curl over, so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.",0
94,25,So comfy and versatile!,,0
94,25,,"Bought this tank on a whim, but i'm so happy i did! so flattering, comfy and well made.",1
94,25,,This is my new favorite shirt!! you can dress it up or down. so comfy and totally flattering :),0
94,26,Cute tunic,"This tunic is very nice. flattering, good design, worn in winter and spring, and fits well. i have a curvy figure, and this fits well. i wish it came in more colors.it does show flaws slightly but fits well and is stretchy.",0
94,26,Purchase immediately,"I do not think i could express how much i love this top! it is so flattering and soft. i love that the bottom half is slightly sheer and a different fabric than the top. it is stretchy, which for me is a wonderful thing. i purchased the day it came in store. it is quickly prone to pilling though!! with the style of shirt it's not so bad, but kind of unfortunate for a top that is almost $100.",3
94,26,,Bought in white. it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear.  the white is pretty sheer. will return.,0
94,26,,"Ordered this is the navy in a size m.....i'm 5' 5"", 135 lbs, 34d. it was huge!!! it is also very billowy but i'm going to try it in a petite s. i also changed colors to the ivory as the navy was really plain. hoping this size change works!",30
94,27,A little disappointed,"I loved this top when i saw it online, and ordered it right away. however, the fit is way off. i am always a size medium. always. but i was swimming in this and had to return it. even if it had fit, i wasn't thrilled with it. i thought it would be something i could dress up, especially with the lace detail, but instead it looked really frumpy. i would recommend this top as long as you know to order a smaller size and are looking for something a little more casual.",0
94,27,"Cute, but runs large","I ordered my normal size and found that this top runs large. i wanted to tie the front ties tighter to accentuate my waist, but even so it was still quite loose. the fabric is very stretchy and thin, and the top was longer on me than pictured in the model. for reference, i am 5'-7"" 155lbs, usually wear a medium/8 in a top. this medium was too large.",0
94,27,"Soft fabric and nice details, billowy design",,3
94,27,The peplum hit me very high on my torso,"The peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage, not at my natural waist, so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up. i am busty so it's possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem. i was disappointed to return it, the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one.",14
94,28,Loooovvvvveee,This shirt is so comfortable and flattering. the quality is really good but i would definitely size down. it's not too heavy and can be worn with skinny jeans/jeggings..,0
94,28,Nice but sleeves and body have volume,"Color is pretty true to pic, a bright blue red.  sleeves have more volume than pic.  so does the body.  in my opinion.  maybe if i looked like the model.  i wear a 27 in jeans and it doesn't look so cute on me.  also i'm a brunette.  angles?  pinning?  i have to wonder.  probably just pics at good angles.  it looks really cute on the model though.",0
94,28,So comfy!,I absolutely love this top! ordered the moss color in size xxs. i am 5'5 105 lbs. i typically wear xs and 0 in retailer clothing. this top is kinda flared/loose fitting so i would size down. the website currently says it's by everleigh but the tag says eri & ali. color is a little darker in person but tie dye effect is spot on. it's beautiful! and super super comfy! i am currently wearing it with my lululemons! but can defin see this top being dressed up with a cute pendant necklace and skinny bla,1
94,29,Bulky!,"I wanted to like this top, as i usually adore a cute peplum feature. when i tried it on yesterday in the store, i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it. i am petite (5'2"", 110 lbs), and i tried my usual xs. the fabric was substantial and of a high quality, but unfortunately in this design, that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me. it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing.",1
94,29,Nice shirt,"This is a nice, soft shirt that is very comfortable to wear. the collar on this shirt makes this more than just a regular shirt. although the shirt seems more fitted on the model, i found it to run large. if you are going for the same look, you might want to size down. however, i like the shirt and am keeping it. it is a good thing too, because the navy color went fast. very nice shirt and a pretty good price too.",5
94,29,"Perfect, elegant & complimentary","Love this shirt. i am actually pregnant and this shirt ties right over my baby bump to make for a very flattering pregnancy shirt. i will definitely be wearing it post pregnancy as well since the tie is an actual tie and you can tie it however tight you want for a more fitted or loose look. i am 5'4 125 lbs (not pregnant) and got a size small. and it fits perfectly. covers problems areas of butt and upper thighs, yet accentuates the waist. and thinner area of legs. very soft fabric, a bit stretc",0
94,29,Short and wide,"I tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs - both were ridiculously wide. they were also both cut really short - the peplum basically started right below my boobs, though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex. the stripes are really cute, the cut is just very strange. 

for reference, the black and white is the small, the taupe is the xxs.",3
94,29,Sleeves are a dealbreaker,"This is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer. the sleeves are so weird and ugly. they get really fat at the top, like a dolman sleeve, but it looks really strange because they don?t flow into the rest of the top, which is very structured. it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders. this is not apparent in the model picture at all. the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri",2
94,29,Soft blouse,"This is one of the softest blouses i now own. it feels and wears like a premium blouse. i love it, and it actually makes my backside look smaller too. even though it is flowy, it is true to size. if you have small arms and a chest than you could go down a size. this is one of my new favorite purchases, and i wear it with the cabled knit bomber and boots.",14
94,29,"Yeah, but it's a great tent!","Ok, this shirt is like my dream.  it's large, comfy but sexy with the back dip.  as a larger chested lady (32g), i really appreciate having a tee that i can easily throw on and look put together.  clearly, this is a larger, styled swing tee but it's one of my favorites.  paired with a cute pair of boots, and easily worn with a jacket.  it can tend to fall off the shoulders so i'd size down.  i'll probably pick up the grey too.",0
94,29,,"Bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes. had little to no shape to it. some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for. i feel like being short, i just looked kind of dumpy on me. fabric is nice but borders on see through. it was just ok....nothing exciting.",4
94,29,,"The design of this shirt is stunning. i can't even tell you how many people complimented me on the shirt. the only thing is it does run a bit long. with it being long, it can go nicely with leggings and boots.

material is a bit thin and should be hand-washed or dry cleaned. i do wish there were more sizes in petite.",0
94,30,If curvy...stay away!,"I had such high hopes for this shirt! i got it in both the black and moss (which is a beautiful color). however, the ruffle was just too big. i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown. it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves, but on me, it was not flattering at all.",4
94,30,Lovely but large!,The quality of this top does not disappoint; but it does run very large. i wear a size 14 and a 40d bra size; & the xl fit more like a xxl and was too big. i am exchanging it for a size smaller. i can't wait to enjoy it!,1
94,30,My new favorite top,"This top is wonderfully comfortable and well made. i've taken a few accidental naps while wearing it because i was just so comfortable. at the same time, i receive complements on the shirt every time i wear it. itt pairs well with so many types of pants. the only negative is that i only own one (the cream color). i regret greatly that i did not purchase it in all available colors when i had the chance! i really hope to see this top come back again later!",0
94,30,No,"Just a ginormous, shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!",5
94,31,Colors look nothing like online photos:(,"When i saw this top online, i thought i'd love it and immediately ordered it in both colors.  they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed.  i have never seen such drab colors.  the blue is a muddy grayish hue (like an overcast day) and the pink is a dusty shade of peach.  yuck.  and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon-like flowy effect.  instead, the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit.  back these go...",0
94,31,Comfy flowy top for fall and winter,Nice quality material. the green is pretty color. just a good cozy top. i normally wear a large in retailer clothes and the large in this world was very roomy (which was fine with me). if you are short and have smaller shoulders and bust definitely go for a size smaller than you would normally wear.,3
94,31,Great detailing & comfy,Love how breezy this shirt is and adds unique texture & detailing to your outfit. the simple black color is a nice touch so the color does not compete with the detailing.,0
94,32,Almost great,"I had been eyeing this top for weeks. it's look so beautiful on the model, however, not great on me. material is fab. the tee is way shorter than it appears online and there is too much flutter material.",2
94,32,Gorgeous white summer tank,"I got this in white and was surprised to see that it fits me. i am very petite but with a 32d bust and purchased the xxs. this fit me perfectly! the fabric is soft and kind of silky, the straps were not too long, the hem hit just at my hip line. i am buying the other color!",0
94,32,Light and cute,"The perfect flowy fall top! the material is thin so it may pick a little, but i love it.",4
94,32,"Runs large, too much fabric","I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag, as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge, everywhere but the neck.",9
94,32,Size down 1-2 sizes,"I am normally a m-l (170 lbs, 5'4"", 34dd). i ordered this top in a medium knowing it ran big, and it is huge. seriously, i could wear it as a dress. i like the whole loose and comfy top thing, but this is so massive it looks sloppy. i'm going try and return it for a small. hey, i like that i can wear a small! the green color really is pretty, and it's so soft. just need a much smaller size.",0
94,32,So soft and flowy,"This tunic is a great length - i'm 5'4"" and it hits me mid/lower thigh. it's so soft and flowy which i love. i got a medium which is my normal size so i would say it runs a little big given that i'm almost 5 months pregnant with my second but it will still look and feel great post baby. arm holes are big but a cami can fix that. i got both colors available: the ivory and light red.",0
94,32,Unique but not orange,"This has a unique style and feel to the fabric which i like. however, the color is not orange as advertised. it's more or a reddish pink tone which was somewhat disappointing because orange is what i was looking for. i will still keep it to pair with other outfits in mind.",0
94,32,,"Best beachy summer tunic in the store. can be worn knotted at the hip or worn straight. can be worn over jeans, shorts, a bathing suit, take your pick. wear it with a tank/cami underneath or not. it works wither way. asymmetrical cut. great for us long-legged tall people. fabulous buy. only con is that it's a tad delicate. unfinished hem and loose-knit. will easily snag if you aren't mindful. i recommend hand wash, air dry.",0
94,32,,I get that it's a swing style top and supposed to be loose but it looked so much bigger on me than on the model and just not flattering at all.,14
94,32,,"This top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between. to be truly slimming & flattering, it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend, to make it heavier & bouncier. then it would ""hang"" appropriately and ""swing"" and (hopefully) not add pounds to the wearer. unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material. pass.",0
94,33,"Cute, but....",I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.,0
94,33,Pretty top,,2
94,33,,"Love this top! i tried it on in the store and instantly loved. i wore it and ordered it in another color. i bought my usual size but decided i'd like to have it slightly smaller for the next one, so i ordered down. it can go either way, it's quite flawy and roomy. cool for summer and supper flattering.",0
94,34,An ode to us hourglass girls!,"This was such a great top! see thoughts below!

___________
pros:
- fits tts. for reference, i'm 5'9, 36c, hourglass. i'm normally a m or l (10 or 12) depending on the fit and found the medium to fit well and not be too tight at all. i could have probably sized down for a snugger fit, but i like the looseness. fit very well across the chest and arms.
- the sleeves are surprisingly flattering. i've dealt with other tops where the sleeves flutter too much and adds too much weight and attentio",19
94,34,Be careful how you wash!,"This shirt is beautiful. it is flowy and light, a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring. however, do not follow the washing instructions on the tag. it says you can machine wash, tumble dry low, and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low, it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it. it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again. if you do order, please take the",16
94,34,Cute top,"This top looks exactly as pictured, it is a little more billowy but i liked that about it. i found that it ran true to size and i am 5'8'', 128lbs and ordered a small. i am going to order the white because the cut is super cute.",2
94,34,I wanted to like this,"This shirt is adorable.
but...it didn't work for me!
i'm a smaller gal with a large chest (5'4"", 34g). i tried on the small, since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight, yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much, making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back, and i would have been in love.
love the blue color!",0
94,34,Lovely!,"This.
an unexpected purchase...i found this on my way to the dressing room.
the fit is stunning. i sized way down (i.e. normally wear 10/12, curvy, and bought a small).
it accentuates my curves, and is incredibly flattering. i bought the navy, and will be adding another color soon!
the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy. it's a nice addition to my work wardrobe.",1
94,34,Nice shirt but runs wide,"I chose to ignore the other reviews saying this shirt was too wide thinking that my wider shoulders would fill it out, but that's not the case. the shirt is adorable and soft and cute on, but just too wide around the armpit/chest area and with the horizontal stripes it just didn't look attractive. i would love to try the next size down to see if it works, but the black and white xxs is sold out so back it went. i am only 5'4"" with a shorter torso so the length was fine for me.",0
94,34,Nice simple staple,,2
94,34,Runs very large,"I love tunics and really wanted this to work. i got this in a size s and it is absolutely gigantic. everything else about it is great, and i still haven't decided if i will try to swap it for an xs, which is definitely not my usual size (which is usually m, but often s at retailer). the pink/red color was quite pretty. if you have broad hips, fear not - you can size down and this top will still be generous around your hips. basically, if you're deliberating between s and m for this top, get",0
94,34,So tent-like and unflattering!,"Looks great on the model, but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didn't matter which size, they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in, but there's too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns, and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a",0

94,35,Comfortable casual tank,"I ordered this in blue, and loved the color. i'm not typically into the flowing top style, but i tried a few items on my last order, this being one. it's unseamed at the bottom, which was my primary reason for returning it - i couldn't see that in the photo online - but if that is your style, this item is good quality, soft, comfortable material, and a great spring or fall blue.",1
94,35,Modern swing,"This is a modern version of the peplum top and very flattering if you don't mind flowy cuts. the material has a nice heaviness to it, and i love the black pebbled effect. 34 d, 130 lbs fit small perfectly.",3

94,35,Very cute and girly!,,1
94,35,,This top is soft and comfortable without being some shapeless drag with too much fabric. i did size down as did the other woman in the store with me. i can see many more wears out of this top. wish it had been made in other colors or white would be beautiful!,0

94,36,Awesome shirt but doesn't hold up well after washi,"I got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it. it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great. however, after i washed it the first time, it became clingy and stuck to me and doesn't lie right. it's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe!",13
94,36,Beautiful tunic,"I am currently loving anything that crosses or ties around the stomach area to hide what's left from my most recent pregnancy. this tunic fits the bill. the material has the perfect amount of stretch and the length was just right. i am very petite and bought my usual size xs. i would have liked to try this tunic in a petite size, but then it  may have been too short. i plan on wearing this to work with leggings and for running errands once the weather warms up.",8
94,36,Comfy and pretty,I bought this in red and wear it a lot. it is so soft and comfortable! i love all the fabric and the design. the longer sleeve length is amazing! it is a perfect tee! you can tell from the pics there's a lot a fabric and it's supposed to be loose and drape like that. it fits like in the pics and is true to size. wear a tank underneath in case there's a strong wind.,0
94,36,Lovely top with one flaw,"The quality of this top is wonderful. thick enough to prevent see-through, but thin enough to create a beautiful drape. the fringe details are lovely. the top is slightly roomy (ranks between ""true to size"" and ""runs large,"" i.e., leaves room in the back when i clasp my hands together and stretch them out in front of me), but not really enough to size up. i'm 5'-4"", 120 lbs., athletic build, and the small fits well. my only issue with the aesthetic is that the pattern of the lace on the upper pa",0

94,38,Nice top!,"I really like this top. it is made of cotton and linen blend, so the fabric is not as soft as i would have expected. however, it did not bother me at all, and i am really liking it.
the fabric is on a sheer side, so it is a bit see through. nothing too revealing, however it is a thin fabric.
overall, i am happy with this top!",1
94,39,Eek!,Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.,4

94,39,Runs very large!,I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that's how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it's comfortable on and loved the lace detail.,0
94,39,"Soft, rich blue","I ordered the xxs because it seems like a flowy top, and glad i did, it fits perfectly. love the blue color, very rich. material is super soft, cut is very flattering, and i love the back. i tried it on with my strapless since that is what i was wearing, but not sure if straps show on a regular bra. (30dd for info)",0
94,39,Too boxy and heavy if you are petite and curvey,,0
94,39,"Unique top, too much material on bottom","I thought this was a pretty and unique top. the material looks and feels like a basic t-shirt made into a striking fitted top. this isn't apparent in the online pictures: the side seams are slitted open nearly up to the waist, so it is a bit revealing. my only problem with this shirt was that the bottom part flared out too much away from my body, and there is a lot of material there, so i wasn't sure if i could get it tailored to look good on me.",0
94,39,Works if you're broad shouldered,"If you are like me and your shoulders are broader than your hips, the boat-neck on this won't be too wide on you.
----------
i am normally a m or l in retailer tops, and went with the m, and i have very large biceps. if you're broad-shouldered but have smaller arms, i would recommended sizing down a size.

i have a very long torso and didn't find this to be too short...but i love jeans with a 10"" rise. if you are going to pair this with low or medium (8.5"") rise jeans, then yes, you will",22
94,39,,Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering.,0
94,39,,"Love this top!! i bought it for school and im dying to wear it. i could see how other people could dislike it bc of the loose frame, but if you like flowy shirts this top is for you! i like how the shirt is made of a really soft and sturdy cotton and the top part is more fitted so the fabric doesnt completely drown you out. also, this top looks super cute paired w/ a bralette and espadrilles!",4
94,40,Very boxy,"This top had potential, but the cut is very boxy and not fitted at all like the front picture shows. the picture from the back is much more representative of what it looks like. i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s and the xs in this was still huge and boxy, but very short with tight sleeves (i have small arms so hardly ever have an issue with tight sleeves). the small fit better as far as length and and sleeves, but still very boxy. the pattern and cutouts are very cute, but thi",9
94,40,,This top runs larger so size down. i love it besides that. it's adorable!,0
94,40,,,0
94,41,Adorable!,"This is such an adorable tee. the stripes and lace up details are super cute and on trend. i usually take a xxs and that is what i took in this tee. i tried the xs and at 5""1 and 104 pounds it looked a bit loose and long on me. love this tee and highly recommend this one!",7
94,41,Easy top,"I like this top. another reviewer mentioned that it was a great top for a busty girl...i agree. i'm a 32g and could have sized down to a small, but i kept the medium because i wanted the extra length to have the option of wearing it as a dress. the small may have caused slight button pulling, but since the fabric has stretch and the top has a generous cut, it wouldn?t look insane. my only issue is the fabric pills. i wore the top once, and the fabric near the armpit pilled a lot, especially for",0
94,41,Great for shorter torsos ... not so much on me,,6
94,41,Huge,"I want to like this top because the idea is cute but i ordered the small and it might have well been xxxl.  with sizing like this, one size fits all could just about do it.",0
94,41,Love it!,,6
94,41,Pretty but swingy,This top is very airly and swingy.  definitely need to wear skinny jeans to off set the volume on top.  it is a pretty top and also unique so i kept it.,1
94,42,Adorable but runs big,"Lovey top in the photos. however, its fairly large and the chest area can make you look even larger. i'm 5'3, 118lbs, 36c. generally wear xs or 2s in retailer tops. ordered the xs but it was just too large and unflattering. the lace work is so pretty. it has potential but the design doesn't work well for some.",1
94,42,Better than a basic,"Lovely feel to this almost-cowl neck turtleneck. it's quite thin, and has 3/4 length sleeves, so it won't keep you warm. but the fabric is soft, the ribbing is flattering, and the fit is loose without feeling frumpy. overall, a good staple that's a bit more interesting. the mauve-ish color looks great with grays.",2
94,42,Comfy and lovely,"This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy, making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!",4
94,42,Fun summer top,"I really like this top! it's lightweight, great quality, and i've worn it for casual weekend outings and also dressed up for work.",0
94,42,Love it!!,"I tried this (black motif) on yesterday in my local retailer store and fell in love...after sizing down! i do have to agree with previous reviewers that this top runs large. i am typically a s, but sized down to xs, and the fit was not even slightly snug. the material is soft and comfortable and i love the asymmetrical draped ""skirted"" bottom..very funky and arty-looking. i am 5'5"" and the regular length was great on me. as much as i will enjoy wearing it all summer, i also can't wait to layer it",3
94,42,,"Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference, i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs, it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight, not trying to look pregnant!",1

94,43,Makes me look pregnant,"I normally wear regular s, but even the xsp is too wide on me. it is really maternity wear. 

also, since the material is thin, the ivory is too shear for my liking.",4
94,43,This blouse has an 80's vibe!,"I wasn't sure i would like this top, but wanted something different, than what i already own. i ordered it in an xs (my usual size) and it is slightly loose (which i knew it would be based on the cut). it looks great with jeans or shorts. i purchased the black and white striped one because it looks more interesting. the ties may drive me crazy- we'll see. i like the weight of the fabric, i just hope it doesn't pill. for reference, i am 5'3 and 123lbs. i usually wear a 2/4.",9
94,43,Versatile piece,,4
94,44,Best shirt ever!!! go get it!!!,"I bought this shirt in every color. i look sexy and the best part is how comfortable it is. it is very versatile. i wear it at networking semi formal events/ dinners/ going out with friends, and everywhere. i feel awesome with it.",0
94,44,Loved this,"Pic doesn't do it justice, very flattering. i got it in navy. definitely worth the sale price!",0
94,44,"Pretty, lightweight shirt for summer but huge","The previous reviewer was right on with her review, including that the shirt is a bit darker in color irl. i'm writing this review to emphasize how large this shirt runs. i'm typically a small in shirts, usually a 4 and occasionally a 6 if it's a very fitted style. i'm 5'5"", 125lbs, 34b, and i went with the xs in this, and it is huge on me. i really like it though, so i'm considering reordering in an xxs, i've never worn an xxs. i'm starting to get frustrated with inconsistent sizing, especially",5
94,44,"So comfy, great fabric","This is such a comfy top, and the fabric is really great. more supple / flowy than i expected. it does run larger than i expected. i typically wear a large, and it's almost more billowy than i would normally prefer. i would love to try a medium to see the difference, but since it was purchased online, i'm just going with it. this will get lots of wear this season.",5
94,44,Versatile top,"Bought in the store, will look great with black or dark blue jeans and a fun long necklace.  does not fit like it looks on the model, it is more fitted.  i plan on wearing a spaghetti strapped cami underneath because the back has a draping effect and is open.  the front is on the shorter side but the bottom of the shirt (not including tassels) reaches the top of my jeans, and the tassels hang below.  it is a very versatile top, one that can be dressed up or down.  sleeves above wrist.",0
94,44,,"Great top! super cute. runs a little big, i usually purchase l but the m fit better. it's thin, but not see through, so it lays well.",0
94,44,,"While i agree with the previous review that the peplum hits a bit high, i like this top. it has other features that i really like. the dip in the back of the peplum is great and i love the longer sleeves. i have it in both the black and the mauve and they are becoming quick staples in my wardrobe. i have a fuller figure and feel good in this top.",2
94,44,,,0
94,45,Frumpy if you are petite,"I loved the criss cross part of this tank. however, it looked so frumpy on. the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent. i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on. i returned it. the material felt nice too.",1
94,45,Love this top!,"I love the fabric, texture mix and length of this top. i gave it a four stars because my usual size is a medium but had to go with a large. a medium felt a bit too snug through the shoulders. very happy with this top and look forward to wearing it a lot.",0
94,46,Cute and comfortable,"I bought the green and white and waiting to see how these wash based on previous reviews. they are definitely not figure flattering and make you a bit boxy. you could belt it, but i won't i'll just wear for errands and lounging, better than my sports tees! i bought mediums because if it shrinks a tad, the small might be too short in the arms and i wanted a bit more arm coverage.",3

94,46,Great shirt,"This is a great shirt, fits perfect and super comfortable but you feel stylish and pretty",0
94,46,So soft!,"Retailer has great designs but sometimes they use cheap fabrics and are not quality made. this top is quality made and super soft. its a little thicker than a normal cotton t-shirt but thinner than a sweatshirt. i normally wear medium (34dd, 135-140 lbs, 5'4"") and this was tts. i got the blue and its a little bit darker in person. one big plus imo is that you can put it in washer and dryer, no need to line dry! i am going to buy the natural colored stripes one too. also, i bought the normal size.",12
94,46,,Cute cute. simple tank with a little something to add interest.,0
94,48,Beautiful unique top,"Love the unique details and neutral color scheme. top is boxy but i liked the way it looked on my 5'2"" 115 lb. frame. it's comfortable and well made. thicker material.  seems to be holding up fine after one washing.  looks great with skinny jeans.  highly recommend!",0
94,48,"Bright, fun blouse","I love this blouse. the color is so pretty! i might even wear this to a holiday party. the tie looks great so many ways--love the versatility. i think i will get a lot of wear out of this blouse--with a pencil skirt, jeans or under a blazer.",1
94,48,Cute breezy tank for summer,"Love this tank! i ordered a small and it fits beautifully. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs. . tank is sheer so i wear a cami underneath. length is quite long but i wear it with skinny white capris and it looks chic. my only concern is the raw hem edge. worried about how this will hold up with some washings. other than that i love it. i received many compliments when i wore it.",0
94,48,Nice blouse,"It's soft and feels nice on skin.
true to size and fits just fine. more form fitting than model picture.",1
94,48,"Pretty, if you have an alterations whiz","Gorgeous sleeves, flattering neckline...and a voluminous torso. i loved the fit of the top portion so much, i decided to buy it, knowing it would require alteration. the seamstress removed a *significant* amount of bulk and added vintage buttons to clasp the inverted pleat. i find many of these ""easy breezy"" tops create a shapeless look. extra volume in both the front and back creates a needlessly rotund profile. despite excellent posture, i looked both hunched and pregnant in the unaltered silh",0
94,48,Sleeve detail is fab!,"This piece is a winner solely b/c of the sleeves. otherwise, it's a plain, large tee. however, the sleeves are gorgeous and so unique! had they had my size left, i would have purchased in other colors (i got pink). it runs large, so size down.",0
94,50,Adorable,I bought this shirt for my 16 year old daughter. it looked adorable on her! she loved it and can't wait to wear it. the fabric felt like a great quality and the color was quite unique.,0
94,50,Flattering and comfy!,This top is my favorite of the season! planning to order in black too.,1
94,50,Love it...,"I just bought this top in size medium and i love it. super comfortable and flowy. if you want to dry it in the machine, just put cold air and it won't shrink. don't use hot air...",10
94,50,Super comfortable and flattering,"I tried this shirt on on a whim in my local store when i was there to shop the sale items an to my surprise, it was very flattering and comfortable. it had a unique fit and design; i tried on the black in an xs (my usual size) and surprisingly, i didn't find it to be too big at all. it fit just like it did on the model. you could almost wear it as a mini dress over leggings/shorts based on the length. like one of the previous reviewers, it would be great if it came in other colors. this top woul",1
94,51,I love this!,"I actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems. i am little (5'1"" and 103) and i don't think it's too boxy at all. i like the way it hangs. and i'll say i like it much more in person than on the model. it's somehow cozier than it looks in the picture. it's a real boosh (that mean's comfy.) i wouldn't have picked it from the online pic, but in person, it really caught my eye.",9
94,51,"Love the color, design and flow","Love this shirt, can dress up or more casual. wish i would of purchased all colors!",0
94,52,"Beautiful, full, flowing","I bought the wine color. typically wear med or large., med was plenty big.... the color is deep and beautiful. is so soft and flowing. i love it!",0
94,52,Perfect with jeans,,1
94,52,"Sloppy, shapeless, ginormous top","I sized way down and this top was still shapeless and tent-like. the sweatshirt fabric overpowered the cute, feminine details.",0
94,52,Warm and comfortable,"I love wearing my boatneck pullover. the unique part of this item is the back with buttons. the shirts appears to be inside out, however, its not. its soft, comfortable, stylish and warm. i really like how it's longer in the back.",0
94,52,,,0
94,53,"Cute top, but...","A very cute and comfy top that's lightweight and falls nicely... but, it does snag very easily. so far, i've worn this top once and found small snags in multiple areas. the snags might blend into the fabric texture if they did not create dark spots. the yarn/thread is a mixture of a celadon tone and black, which concentrates the black when snagged.",0
94,53,My go to,This is so comfortable and flattering and hides everything but yet is fun! i actually love to wear it with jeans. and it goes great with a really great piece of jewelry.,0
94,53,This one's a keeper,"Really cute top(especially the back)!  i've tried on several of these tops that overlap in the back and none of them lay as nice as this one.  the soft cotton fabric really works well with this style.  runs tts and i love that the arms are more fitted with some stretch to the fabric.  regular length works fine on my petite frame as well.  the color is a darker cream and almost has a slight nubby effect to it.  first one i received had a snag/hole in the lower sleeve, so hopefully it holds up.",0
94,53,Unflattering cut,Unfortunately this top looks billowy and boxy on my. i am tall and very slim and i look pregant in this one ;). maybe it works better on somebody more curvy.,0

94,54,Cute and comfortable,,0
94,54,Great swing top,"Love this top. yes it is a swing top so you have to be prepared for the extra fabric. fits true to size thru the shoulders and chest. body of the top then flares for the ""swing"" effect. great top. plan on ordering it in the other colors.",3
94,54,Huge!,,3
94,54,Just a blah top,"I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived, i was excited to try it on, but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large, not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end, i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad, as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.",2
94,54,Nice top,I received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror. it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans. i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see. the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure. it is longer as it appears on the model. i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price!,0
94,54,So cute,"Love this top, very flattering. love it so much, i actually wish it was a dress...a knit summer dress with a tie at the waist would be perfect. seems to run a little big, so if you're deciding between sizes, size down.",0
94,54,Super cute but fits like a petite,"I loved this top, and i normally order petites when i'm able to, but this wasn't offered in a petite size so i took a chance and ordered it in regular. just got it in the mail and when i pulled it out i thought wow, it is a petite! but its not, just runs small. i got the xs size and it was tight under the arms, and the peplum bottom came up a bit high and felt slightly maternity-ish the way the bottom part flared out. i actually thought it was a bit too short too, even on me (5'2"", about 118 lbs",15
94,55,Breezy & comfy,"This top does run large. i'm 5'8 142 lbs and usually a medium. i bought a small and probably could have gone xs. that said, i love this top. its soft and comfy and swingy. i bought the light red and its pretty true to the online color.",0
94,55,Elegant,"I love this t-shirt, i feel classy, stylish and comfortable wearing it. as other reviewers have noted, it is bellowy in the peplum, but that is the design and i love it. it looks great with skinny jeans and can be dressed up or casual. another terrific purchase from retailer!",1
94,55,Just adorable !! a must for every wardrobe,I just received this and absolutely love it !!! i love cold shoulder designs and this one is unique and so well made. i am usually a size small and it fit perfectly. i would say it runs true to size and will look perfect with white or black pants and a cute sandal. i am so glad i got it. love the quality .,17
94,55,"Love the color & open shoulders, but too blousy","I love the color (coral/pink) and the open shoulder design of this top, but it's too blousy at the bottom (way too much fabric). i ordered a small. i am 5'4"" and 120 lbs. i might try an xs if they still have them in stock. fabric is comfortable. the ties on the sleeves add a special touch.",0
94,55,"Love the sleeves, but it runs quite large","I ordered this on-line. i love the sleeves and the pleat in the back, but the top runs large. i ordered a small, but it is too big. other reviews say that the top shrinks when you wash it. however, i'm not sure if the store would let me return a washed item if it doesn't shrink enough for my taste. i think i will probably be returning this top.",1
94,55,Lovely summer blouse,"This is a really well made, great looking blouse. the details are charming. i like that it is a good weight, not too sheer. the 3/4 sleeves are perfect. i ordered a medium and it is a good fit overall. so glad i put it in my shopping cart to try. it's a keeper!",5
94,55,"Nice, but too long","I loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets. the fabric was a nice weight, not too thin like lots of retailer tops. i liked the top from the front, however the back was way too long, especially with the looseness of the style. it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted. it might work on someone taller. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. and i tried xs.",2
94,56,Comfortable and flattering,"This unique blouse is very comfortable and looks beautiful on the body. it flowy and flattering and looks great with my tan. dress up or down, it's a staple in my summer wardrobe.",0
94,56,"Cute top, better for fall than summer","This top is sooo cute. it does not look like pajamas as one person said, it looks like a top. it's a bit on the boxy style, so anything you want to hide below is well covered. has a nice length to it. is not just for lounging. paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great. i ordered the xl (i am a 40d for reference) and it hung very nicely. its extremely soft and very comfy. i only wish they had more colors.",0
94,56,Runs large,"I was excited to receive this tunic in the red (more of a rose color) yet so disappointed to find out how large it runs. my usual size with retailer is a small (sometimes, xs). after reading through the reviews, i ordered an xs and even the xs is too big -- just too much fabric. unfortunately, the xxs is sold out and the xs will be returned.",0
94,57,Well made; but huge,"The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.",1
94,58,The fringe on the bottom is great!,"I love this tank top...the fringe on the bottom is fun, and i've gotten many compliments on it already...i think it runs true to size :-)",0
94,59,Cute top,"I like the top; like the tie in the front. the material is stretchy. would imagine this will work for any size of chest. i wear either a small or medium, so thought i'd be safe order the medium, which turned out to fix more like a large. i'm taking it back for the small.....as it's a keeper.",12
94,59,Looks great on me!,"I read the other reviews before i ordered this top and was a little concerned about the fabric, but it's fine. the neutral color is a little bland, but i can wear it with bright pants. since i expected it to run large i ordered a small. the tie in the front makes it fit like a dream, plus it looks amazing from the back.",0
94,59,Loose fit beautiful color and style,This is a beautiful color and nice heavier fabric. love the style. armholes not too big. the body is loose fitting at torso but chest area is fitted at 36 c size small . i love this top with skinny jeans or pencil skirt as shown on model. top looks just like it does on model as far as fit.,9
94,59,So great,Just got the small peach in the mail; love it. also got the black small petite; works great as this shirt is pretty long. great boho tee.,0
94,60,Cute very oversized t-shirt,"This is a cute waffle t-shirt material is very thin and see-through it's a cute shape and style but it runs absolutely huge 
 is not a shirt for petite people
 the extra extra small was huge",2

94,60,Lovely top for different body type than mine,"Lovely, comfortable top.  not flattering on my full figure but would be flattering on most--especially younger women who want to emphasize their curves~~",1
94,60,Unexpectedly flattering,"I did not have the same experience as the other reviewers. found the color just as pictured - a dusty pink (made to look worn - so may not be your thing). fabric hangs nicely and is slimming on me. long enough for leggings but great with jeans, booties and long necklace (needs accessorizing). the aged look may not be for all, but overall i love it.",0
94,60,Weird,The way the back came down so much made the top look weird. i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much. also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture. so to me it was just a over priced odd top.,1

94,62,Everyone needs this,"This is my new favorite white top in my closet - the loose fit, flowy quality fabric, and effortless versatility are spot on for anyone's wardrobe. i took my usual size s - i wouldn't size down in this because although it's roomy in the torso, the sleeves and shoulders fit perfectly on my thin arms. everyone should have this beauty!",0
94,62,So fun and comfy!,"I purchased this in the ivory color in store and liked it so much i ordered the plum color on-line. i am almost always an xl, but this fit better in the l size. it's very soft and comfy and i love the swingy style. will be wearing it a lot!",0
94,62,Unique lightweight knit,"I think this is going to be a love or hate top. i love it. it is see through, requiring an under top. however, the fabric is extremely light weight and the style is floaty so a simple lightweight tank/cami will look pretty showing through in a number of colors. i bought the off-white. it is meant to be a full fit but i think going down one size will help especially since the photos don't show just how full the back really is. the fabric will probably snag easily. still i just really like the sty",10
94,62,,"I wasn't expecting to like this tank as much as i do because of the other reviews...i thought i would send it back if i didn't like it, i appreciate the design, fabric, and construction! i plan on wearing it out to dinner with some friends coming in from out of town tomorrow night...can't wait!",3
94,63,Super cute and comfy,"I love this shirt so much!!! i ordered the gray a day after i received the sage color. this shirt is soft, true to size, comfortable and extremely flattering. it is one of my new favorite go-to shirts. retailer - great job at finding a stylish, casual top that can take me through all the seasons.",0
94,63,,I'm a 32ddd and this top fit perfect. i wore it with boyfriend jeans and flats. the material is nice and perfect for fall,0
94,63,,"What a beautiful flowing top. i am either a large or xl in tops but only needed a large in this top. i purchased it in the neutral color, but will probably get it in plum. if you have some flaws in your middle, this conceals everything. the material is so soft. you can dress it up or down and wear it from now until late fall. the plum color was beautiful, but i have more to wear with neutral. a great, versatile top.",28
94,64,"Nice, but not for me","I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure, why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference, it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel, nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you, but not for me. back it went.",2
94,64,Not worth the money,"I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made, then it would have been a winner!",9
94,64,This is huge!,"If you're pregnant, congratulations. this shirt is for you. if you've ever dreamed of being an xxs, this shirt is also for you. i'm a 34d, normally a small or medium, but often size down to xs in swing tops. the xs is ginormous on me, although it fits through the shoulders. i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides, it's that wide. think flying squirrel. what doesn't show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve, which makes it look wide at the to",3
94,64,"True to size-a bit big, but a great casual top","This is definitely again, a bit big. i'm usually a med, that is what i got, i could have gotten a small, but the arm holes might have been a tad tight then. i'm keeping the med, in case it shrinks, as it is part rayon, and rayon always shrinks if put in the washer. it is a great casual piece that will go with most anything. i love the tie, as you can then tighten the waist up a bit, or leave looser. the material is soft and not clingy. this is why i love a rayon blend. it hits me below my waist",0

94,65,So soft but tickles :d,"The fabric is divine. it's a thin polyester knit that just floats on your body. it's soft and drapes wonderfully. it's like wearing a nightgown. 

the styling is so sexy. it looks really alluring but it's actually just a plain ol' tank top with a bit of a sleeve dangling at the elbows. it's very modest really.

the silly thing is, it tickles! yeah those dangling ties tickle your arms when you move. lol

i bought the grey in a xl and the fit is perfect. it says ""dark grey"" but it's really l",0
94,66,Darling!,"This top is just darling!  the body of the top is lightweight ""sweatshirt"" type material that's dyed to appear well used.  the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured.  great to wear with leggings!  the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered.  extremely comfortable, machine washable.  an unexpectedly ""nicer than it looks online"" garment.  i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl.",0
94,66,Is this top for 2 people?,While i love the green color and the soft waffle knit of this top it was so wide i could have fit two of me standing side by side into it!  i mean it was truly laughable!  don't know what the manufacturer was thinking but this one needs to go back to the drawing board.,0

94,67,Don't put it in the dryer,I loved this sweater when i bought it. wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag. it shrunk at least two sizes! and the tassels got all tangled (which i guess i should have seen coming). pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on.,0
94,67,Effortless beauty!,"I have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store. it was a good sign when i saw our stores in-house stylist wearing it! i absolutely love the fit--it's soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality. i'm typically a medium, sometimes large--i bought the medium and it's perfect. i could have gone down to a small as well. the large was way too big (for reference i'm 5'8"", athletic, 150lbs). this top is going to take me everywhere this summer! worth a try!",2
94,67,Love!!,"I feel for the reviewer who didn't like this top. i tried on my normal size medium and it was not very flattering (just too short). when i sized up, everything changed. this top is amazing--super flattering and high quality. i love the material, v-cut, and subtle way the tassels hang. i wish they had more colors-i would buy them all! this top sold out in a day at my store. it's a winner-just make sure you size up.",4

94,71,Adorable,"I thought this top would make me look extremely boxy, but i couldn't resist the stripes and the cut of the top. i did size down, and so glad i did! adorable .... fun and flattering! and that's coming from a curvy girl, with a ddd bust. soo soft!!!!",16
94,71,Overall great shirt,"Overall this is a great shirt. the material is soft and a little sheer, but not sheer enough to have to wear something underneath. the only negative is that the v sits a little high so i felt like i was constantly pulling the shirt down through out the day.",0
94,72,"All-around quality, but big","This is a top-flight notch: an attractive design, nicely made. for me, the fabric is rather heavy for summer wear, but that won't prevent me from keeping it for cooler days. my one complaint is the sizing. i weigh a bottom-heavy 146 lbs. and hoped i'd get away with a medium. but it swims on me...not ""a bit too large,"" but ""way too large."" i'm returning it and hoping that a small will be small enough.",4

94,75,This is this season's favorite brand for me.,This is tee is so soft and the other one in the same brand is the same. love the details also and the color wash.,0

94,86,Loved these!,"I saw online and bought in white and moss! moss is darker in person. i am 106, 5'1 but a 30f and the top fits very well. it actually minimized my chest which i love! not sure how well this would fit on small-chested ladies. not super clingy in the midsection but will look nice with pants or skirts. super happy!",8

95,52,Beautiful sweater but strangely cut,"This sweater is beautiful and well made, but i found the cut strange and unflattering. i ordered it in my usual size small, and it was too big in the shoulders and arms, with a lot of fabric bunching up under my arms. but it just fit me in the chest, and would be too tight if i sized down. this might work for you if you are not busty and order a size down from your usual.",0

96,20,"Great, comfortable pants","The pants were true to size in the waist but they were a touch long for my 5'5"" 120 lbs frame (i got a size 0). they did stretch out a little during the day (i wore them about 10 hours), but not nearly as much as the other reviews led me to believe. however, they were a little loose on my legs when i first put them on, which i liked.",0
96,23,Extra,"I did purchase the pants but ultimately ended up returning because everything such as the print and the length it hits at your ankles is great but there was, at least for me, a lot of extra fabric in the crotch area (and this is not to be crude, there really isn't another word that i can use) and when you sat down, it is extremely apparent. i am 5""6' and run between a size 8 and 10 and 10 fit me, but again, i just think if there was less fabric in the saddle, it wouldn't ride up and look more fl",9
96,24,Wonderful pants,"I walked into a local retailer store and saw these pants. talk about love at first sight. they have an amazing look and fit! usually, i have to buy petite-sized pants, but the length fit at my ankle, and i like the look better than what is shown. since it is still summer, i paired the pants with a cute white tank and black flip flops, but can't wait to mix it up with a cute bootie and sweater.",1

96,25,Flatteringly cute,"My only wish is that the front waistband were more high-waisted, but other than that, the pants are darling--flattering, vintage yet on-trend and made with high quality fabric and tailoring. i am 5'2"" 125 pounds and i bought a size 4. they are a perfect fit.",0
96,25,,,0
96,26,For work and play,I knew i had to have these when i saw them on one of the retailer store instagrams. i bought them in the blue color combo and they are very comfortable and can be dressed up for work or paired with more casual clothing because of the material. they run a little large and have a lot of stretch so i would size down.,1
96,26,Stretches out majorly,,0
96,27,Adorable,"I have never purchased printed pants before, but i was so smitten with the cute little shells that i had to try them on. i was impressed with the fabric, which has some thickness to it but will still be perfect for summer. i also have athletic calves and unlike other cartonnier pants i've tried, i had no trouble getting these over my legs! win win! i'm usually a size 8 and while it was fitted (not loose like on the model) i know they will stretch. being 5'4'' i'm just on the boarder of having mo",4
96,27,Perfect fit,"The fit on these pants is just right for me. i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs. these pants don't gap in the back, as fitted pants often can. easy to dress up or down. the color hasn't held up as well as i hoped, so take care when laundering.",3
96,27,"Super comfortable, stylish jumpsuit","This is my first ever jumpsuit purchase, and i love it! the retailer by me luckily had an xs in stock for me to try, and it fit perfectly (i'm 5'7"", 120lbs, slim). looking at the pictures i was a little concerned the jumpsuit would be short, but the length actually hits me closer to my ankles (still a couple inches above). the jumpsuit feels nice and light and comfortable and not difficult to get in and out of. the embroidery detail on the shoulders is a nice touch and the print is fun. would defi",0
96,28,"Colorful, comfy pants","Ordered these pants in an xs (5'5, 110lbs) -- they fit well in the waist, but are quite long so i roll the waist band down once. they are super fun & funky - i mainly plan to wear them around my house so i don't mind rolling the waist band. if i were going to wear them out, i'd probably have to pair with heels as they are a few inches too long. light & airy material perfect for summer, & cute detail on the pocket seams too.",0
96,28,Will order more in different colors!,"I am 5'5 about 110 lbs and the size 0 regular fits me well. sometimes i order petite, but the regular fit me just right. they are higher waisted than most pants i wear, but they are completely adorable and comfortable to boot. love the pattern. the sturdy quality is tangible. definitely going to order more of these pants in different patterns as they become available.",0
96,28,,"I really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 (my typical size) - the jumpsuit doesn't have a waist, i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist. most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow. also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it's the longest zipper i've ever seen. it's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any. i will sadl",10

96,30,Great fit,"These fit me really well. i tend to have a problem finding trousers that fit my more muscular legs and my waist. usually, if it fits my legs the waist is too big. the trousers have some stretch for a better fit. the only downside is that i had go them hemmed (bought regular size).",0
96,30,Love these pants,"I bought these pants on a whim while i was at my local retailer. i was so delighted after trying them on because i've never tried on a pair of linen pants that i actually liked. they definitely have more of a flair leg rather than straight leg like the picture suggests. i wore them for several hours at a party and they didn't stretch that much on me. i agree with the other review in that they do get a little wrinkly but not much more than what i would expect from linen fabric. i'm 5'3"" so t",5
96,30,Perfect romper,I always look at jumpsuits but they never seem to work for me because of my height (5'1) and petite stature. i ordered the xxsp and it fits perfectly! so comfortable and made of high quality silk which you can really feel is well made. love that there is no zipper- just a hidden elastic tube top and a hook and eye below the nape of the neck. plan on wearing this for my 30th birthday with heels or booties and a cropped leather jacket!,1
96,30,"Pretty, but extremely thin","This item is pretty, the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery, but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents. my issue with it is it's very impractical. the fabric is extremely thin, and you wouldn't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees. it's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season. the tube top underneath doesn't work very hard to stay up, and isn't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit (why wouldnt they just stitch a lining",0
96,30,The only jumpsuit i own,"I am not really a fan of jumpsuits/rompers/etc. but i love this jumpsuit. very good quality and design. fits well, but i thought the 4 was pretty large for a 4. i mean, i probably should have gotten a 2 (which was sold out), but i don't usually have to get a 4 tailored. i did in this case, but it was still worth it.",0
96,31,"Love, but with one problem","These pants fit great, true to size, heavy enough to withstand winter, and the knees don't stretch out as some pants are prone to experiencing. the one problem is that the zipper is exposed on the inside of the pants so it tends to rub against my upper leg and can be quite uncomfortable. it's nothing wearing a pair of spanx couldn't take care of so i've kept them despite this design flaw.",1
96,31,Perfectly long,"I love these pants! the pattern is polished and the flowy style is perfect for warm weather. i ordered a small and was worried they would be too short (i'm 5'10""), but they are just right when i wear them just slightly lower than my true waist. my new favorite summer pants.",0
96,31,Suffer for modern fashion,"I've worn this twice now. the first time was after trying it on and realizing it was perfect. immediately purchased and never took it off. the second time, wore it to my internship (office) followed by museum and a concert. incredibly versatile. constant compliments. 5'7"", 135 pounds, 34 c, 27/28 waist. meant to be loose, carefree, incredibly modern. does wrinkle after long periods of sitting, but not enough to dislike. the biggest complaint for me and my retailer coworkers is that it is an incred",1

96,34,Silhouette not as great as pictured,"The straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband, mostly caused by the pockets. their openings protrude out right below the waistband. it's not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips, they give the impression of extra hips. if not for that silhouette issue, i would keep the trousers, as they are comfortable and pretty, and unlike my other trouser options. not see-through, as i feared.",3
96,34,Stretches out,"I am normally between a size 0 and 2, so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work. the 0 seemed pretty tight all around, so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist. of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out, was bagging in the crotch area, sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees. i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o",17

96,41,Fabric too stiff,"These ran true to size, but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving. i'm athletic and have lean legs, but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh. and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric. i loved how they fit at the waist, but the legs just didn't work for me. sadly returning these.",5
96,41,Odd fit,"I thought the photo of these pants was so cute. when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were. i held the waist up to my chest, just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground. i am not a short woman! i ordered a 14, i am 5' 6"". i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size.",3
96,41,Perfect!,,4
96,41,Super cute,"I feel slim and comfortable in these cute trousers.  got compliments at work.   they are definitely more of a work pant, due to the material.  i think i could wear them outside of work (look-wise), but maybe wouldn't feel as comfortable in them after the hours of nine-to-five, due to the material.",0
96,41,Super cute for the office!,"So, i usually find that retailer tops run large (everywhere else i'm a medium, but i'm always a small at retailer) but with pants or slacks i'm usually an 8 and i always have to size up in retailer to a 10, but based on some of the other ""runs large"" reviews, i stuck with my normal size 8 and they fit perfectly! super cute. not lined, but the material has a nice weight to it, so that doesn't bother me. will def be wearing to the office.",0
96,41,,"Finally a jumper that works for me! i am 5'6 but i have a long torso so most jumpers ride up in an uncomfortable way. this one is perfect. the material is light and perfect for warm weather. the top is very adjustable for all different chest sizes. i personally think the pant length looks better if you are under 5'8"" because it comes down closer to the ankle but then again if you have long thin legs you might not mind the bottom hitting at your calf. i can't say enough good things about this jum",11

96,42,"Lovely pants, but the strecth out a great deal","I really like the pattern and the cut of these pants. the fabric is nice, too. however, i was disappointed how much they stretched out the first (and only) time i wore them. i am 5'6"" and about 150 lbs. i ordered size 10; i am going to try to exchange them for a size 8 since they stretched so much.",0
96,42,"Super cute, form fitting, good neutral","I saw these paired with the denim swing tank in the store and was inspired by the nautical look! the fit was a little snug. i am between a 4-6 in pants and definitely had to go with the 6, and even that was a little tight. for reference i am 5'6 and 125 lbs, curvy on bottom. the sales lady said they will stretch and there is some give to them, but i don't anticipate a lot of stretch. they are slim fitting all the way down and are flattering to the rear. i think they look better in person than on",10

96,43,Standout pants,"Amazing pants! i saw them at my local retailer and knew they would be great addition to my wardrobe (in-person is even better than photo!). they are flattering and i love that the pattern lends itself to many options...could be an ivory sweater or blouse or perhaps a mustard jacket...so much fun! i am 135 lbs, 5'7"" and went with the 6.",0

96,44,Great spring/summer pants!,"These pants are so comfortable, it's ridiculous. they are lightweight and perfect for spring/summer at the office or an evening out. i am 5'9"" and the pants fit as pictured. i paired with a sweater and kitten heels. they do run a little large so consider going down a size.",2
96,44,Love these throw back pants!,"I love clothes, and my mom raised me to look for styles that are different, and unique. these pants are it! they fit beautifully, but run slightly big. i'm between a 4 and a 6, actually kept both. the 4 fits great in the hips and legs, plenty of room if you have curves (i do not), but it's a tad tight in the waist, if that helps. these are a perfect length, at 5' 7"" they hit above my ankle bone, and look perfect w a pointed, closed shoe. i love the colors, and am bored to death of black and grey",0
96,44,,"Me: 5'6"", 130, waist 28/29, hips 36. bought the size 4. i'm expecting a bit of stretch to allow a bit more room for the booty...3% spandex and they seem like standard cartonnier 'charlie' fit.
i love the kicky cropped flare.
they're described as grey motif but everyone in store (and i agree) called them green. the main diamonds are forest green with a grey/green inset and a blue/grey inset inside that. (whew!)
they come with an extra button, keep it as those tiny buttons are going to be first",10
96,45,Great pants!,"I love charlie pants. i've bought a few in the past, and i've never been disappointed with quality, style, or fit. i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result. i wish more pants were side zip- so much more flattering. i got these in a 4, my usual size, and the fit is perfect. i also got these in the regular, rather than petite, but the length works just fine for my height. i bought these in the grey stripe, but like them so much i think i'll order another pair in the orange.",1
96,45,"Love these pants, highly recommend!","I often find wearing anything described as 'slim' difficult, but these pants are absolutely wonderful. i bought in a size 12 regular length. they are perfect, both in fit and quality.",1

96,45,Super comfy and great fit!,"I think this is the first time i've successfully purchased pants online. i normally have to try a bunch of styles and sizes on before i find the right ones. i gave it a shot with these, and bingo! they are great! they are a bit longer on me than on the model, because i am 5'3"" and did not order a petite. i still like how they look, hitting just above my ankle. just the right blend of conservative and cool for lecturing in front of college undergrads.",0
96,46,Fabulous pants,"I have a booty, and these pants love it. they fit my curves (size 10 with flat abs, but as i said a booty) all while looking professional. at m y husband's insistence i'm buying they grey too.",3

96,47,Good pants,"I bought a pair in both black and green. i sized up one size because of previous reviews. i am happy with the fit. they are very comfortable, look good and keep their shape. the only negatives are after two washings, (following the directions-cold water, no dryer), the black has faded and the hook closure on one is difficult to close and the other was barely attached. overall, i would still recommend them.",0

96,48,Classy look,"Loved these culottes! flattering fit and nice drape. the fabric, though poly, is of a nice weight and swishes nicely as you walk. the length (just below knee length) works for me too. the color is lovely for the fall - rich copper and easy to pair . i'd say these are tts but if in doubt, size down. i""m between a size 8-10 and the 8 works best for me.",0

96,48,Stylish and very warm,"It's like a coat for your legs, and lined with some silky fabric. the only flaw is a slight bulkiness where the fly hooks up.  i am a little sad that they don't have a petites, because i think this is proportioned for women 5'5"" and over, and i am only 5""3"". also not recommended for anyone with a tummy pooch. so tall women with somewhat flat abs - snap it up. it's a fabulous look for you.",0

96,49,Very comfortable,I love these pants. i saw them and had to have them. i love the classic plaid style and have always loved the blue/green combination. i purchased the fisherman sweater and saw these pants and new it would be a hit. get compliments on this combo all the time.,1
96,50,Adorable and high quality,"These pants are very, very cute and high quality. they can be worn with a variety of colors and can be dressed up or down. they are also very flattering. i definitely recommend sizing up as they run small. my normal size was a tad tight in the waist and there is very little stretch - but the next size up was perfect.",5
96,50,Very unflattering!,"Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small, are really tight from the thigh up, run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work, and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made, like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model, they would look good",1
96,51,Another winner,Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you,5
96,51,Maybe not for everyone,"Got these in the red brick color, and unfortunately had to send them back. these are really cute and i loved the color and pattern, but they ran very small, and the cut between the legs and hips was odd. this may not have been a problem had i gone up at least one size. best to try them on if possible.",0
96,52,Classic and timeless,"I was a little concerned ordering these online without seeing them in person but they do not disappoint! the fabric has a little texture to it that makes them look and feel like a high quality pant. the design is unique and provides visual appeal, and i still feel like i can wear them in my office without looking out of place. i love the high waist on these!",2
96,52,Dress them up or down,"Let me talk about the fit. i am a size 6 petite. i weigh 120 and am 5' tall. i am curvy and have short legs. what little height i have is in my torso. that being said, i ordered the 6p and the 6. no doubt about it! the 6p fits like a 4p. the 6p was tight in the hips and thighs. the size 6 regular was a perfect fit. if you want the pant to have s cropped look like in the picture then order up a size and stay in petite. so i would have ordered a 8p i'd i wanted the cropped look like in the pic. bu",5
96,52,For long slender legs,"I ordered a six 6 petite. the pant leg was still very long. and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare. this is a slim fit. i have heavy thighs and this was not for me. i'm 5' 120 lbs. also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing. which i don't get, because it's spandex blend. also wasn't too hip in the zipper on the back.",23

97,30,Great fit,I bought the fuschia colored tank to wear under a sweater for the fall. great color. fits well.,0
97,30,,,0
97,32,White tank,I bought the white tank and the small fits me but it's very low cut for me. the white is sheer as well. i usually wear an xs or a small and i would be curious to see what the xs would fit like in the sense of how low cut it is.,0
97,33,"Perfect cut, very thin",Love love love the cut of this tank top. it's is super thin and see thru however. wish it was made a bit thicker. i got it in white and you can see right thru it. however the cut is so fabulous i can over look that.,0
97,35,,Awesome basic top for your wardrobe. it's a little sheer but not too much.,0
97,36,Please bring back more!!!,"Love this tank! prettier shade of yellow in person. love the strap width and length. wish they'd bring back more in lots of colors. i sized up one from my usual size and will have to shorten the length of the strap myself, but it's an easy alteration and is totally worth it! especially good at sale price. i really hope they make more in the style in lots of colors. great find!",0
97,36,,"I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great, soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.",0
97,38,Sheer but great fit,"I wish there were 100 colors, i'd buy them all. the white is super sheer, but i'll use it as a bottom layer for something.",0
97,39,Awesome tank or layering piece!,I really like this top. perfect underneath cardigans or on its own. the fabric is a bit thin so light colors may be see through. love the wider style so there is no bra show. versatile. i see myself purchasing more of these!,0
97,41,Cute tank,I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.,2
97,42,Good basic but runs a bi big,"I love this tee, and am a picky tee person. it runs big, the striped colors are even bigger but i washed in warm and dried them and they are great. super soft and sexy for a tee! i bought the xxs and i am 115 lbs and 5'2"". i like the longer length -- cute with leggings. not 5 stars due to stretched out arm holes.",4
97,44,Hit or miss,"I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly, but is more flattering that way.",2
97,45,Special tee,"There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect, the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening, and the cut (length, wide straps, and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure, skin color, and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...",0
97,49,"Great tank, love the wider straps",I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!,0
97,52,Could be great,"I have bought 4 of these, but after 1st wash on 2 of them and they were in a lingere bag, there are little holes on the front of each, now they are bum around shirts. if they go on sale i will purchase, but the material needs to be better.",1
97,54,Fun tshirt design,"Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small , and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium.",10
98,23,Lovely,"This is such a lovely blouse! the color is true to the picture. i am a bigger girl--5'9"" and size 12, and i bought the large. the fit was beautiful--it was forgiving on my less-than-perfect midsection, but wasn't billowy at all. it did not pull around the shoulders or bust the way some button-up blouses do.",14
98,23,,,7
98,24,Easy breezy :),Gorgeous top! very beautiful and easy. can be dressed up for work or just worn with a pair of jeans. note the fabric is semi sheer so a nude bra or cami is a must with this but it's going to be fantastic for summer!,0
98,25,Strange shirt,"This shirt was strange. the bow tie was too thin and the dots were too dominant on the shirt. it looks okay in the model picture, but when i tried it on the bow and the dots just clashed.",0
98,25,Stunning blouse,"Even on sale i was hesitant about paying so much for a blouse, but i'm so happy i did! the fabric looks as high quality in-person as it does in the picture, and it isn't see-through. the main color of the top is less powder pink and more nude in my opinion, but the color is lovely and the various purples and grays of the arrow details really pop. the buttons down the back are a fun, cute detail, and tone down the more professional look of this blouse in order to wear it with jeans for going out.",0
98,26,"Cute top, but beware it shrinks!!",,4
98,26,Simple yet charming,"I really wish i could keep this top. the material is okay and i have noticed with this brand, shirts made from this material do not wash well or look that nice after a wash. if you have the time to dry clean then i would 100% recommend this top. another tip if you buy this (since i didn't read the description) the top has buttons all down the front. i am not a fan of button tops because i have a larger chest so i wouldn't recommend this top to someone who is busty.",2
98,26,Too loose at bottom,"This top is not for a curvy figure. the embroidered part is gorgeous, very stunning, but the loose bottom part is awful. i am curvy and usually wear l or xl. this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom, made me feel like i had a big tummy, and was a tad short. i am sending this back. this would look better on a more slender frame.",5
98,27,My absolute favorite top,,7
98,28,Shrunk!,"I was so excited about this top, super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold, hand wash, air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed.",0
98,28,,Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.,0
98,30,Beautiful - the first time you wear it.,"This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag, with only a quick ironing. unfortunately, the first time i washed it (cold water, hang dry), it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy, is much shorter, and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately, after i had purchased and washed!), i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only, because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno",1
98,31,Beautiful detail but delicate,"The detail on the fabric of this blouse is beautiful and unique, especially the peachy/pink and orange detailing which is hard to see in the picture. the fabric and seam are quite delicate though so it just needs to be worn and handled with care. fits true to size. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c and the small is perfect.",6
98,31,Nice,"Darling top, lovely dark rich raspberry red color. runs very large so definitely size down. i ordered the s and m. i am usually m but went with the small. the s was smaller in the shoulders of course but not terribly- it was only an issue when i hugged myself. in the picture it looks like it fits her very well. i don't feel like it fits me quite as well- it's borderline maternity-ish... just a little too large and should come in at the waist just a touch more. i agree the bow i.e. seems weak (fa",1
98,32,Beautiful,This top is just adorable. i'm usually between an xs and a small and i went with the small and it's a little more roomy. i wanted it to be long enough. the colors are beautiful and it's a must have.,0
98,32,Cute top,I was pleasantly surprised to find this piece in stock at my local store. it's a very comfortable top with plenty of room. the only criticism i have regarding it is that it's a bit maternity-esque. bought it in an xs.,3
98,32,Very pretty in person,"The top is quite lovely and good quality. i ended up getting a size 4, which fit similarly to the model photos. i am smaller up top and wide in the hips, but the shape worked well for my shape.",1
98,33,Dissapointed,I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.,0
98,33,"Fun, neutral layering piece","This top is a great neutral layering piece with some nice visual interest. the black-and-white pattern and tie-neck style will add a little something to a cardigan or blazer. the neck can also be tied multiple ways. it's definitely appropriate for work and i found it tts. i normally wear a 10/m, and took an m in this top.",6
98,33,Poor quality,The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots,0
98,33,,"Cute and simple top. a little tight through the bust. looks great tucked or out, and super cute with a simple jacket. easy piece to dress up or down.",0
98,34,So-so,"I had been eyeing this top for a while so i was so happy to see it go on sale! i was so excited that i went to my local retailer to try to purchase it right away. unfortunately this top did not fit me right. on the model it looks adorable, on me it was frumpy & ugly. the petite is sold out so i tried a regular medium (i'm usually in-between a medium & a large) & it fit me big & just didn't do anything to my figure. i agree with the other reviewers that the bow was too thin & flimsy & needed to be",2
98,34,Wish it were made out of cotton,"It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???",7
98,34,,"This top is great and perfect for fall/winter. i've gotten a lot of wear out of this so far...great with jeans and sneakers for a casual look, or dress it up with black jeans and boots. great layering piece as well. the fabric is soft and comfortable. the fit is nice and relaxed, but tailored on the sides to give you some shape. the colors are beautiful.great buy, i highly recommend!",2

98,35,Pretty blouse!,"I love this blouse! i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on. this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging. i don't live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively. i have larger hips (135lbs, 5'6) and finding flattering tops can be tough. sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on, they just don't look right. some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter. this top looked great a",0

98,37,Beautiful blouse,"I'm going through a blouse phase, and this was exactly what i wanted. i'm not svelte, and blouses rarely hang off my frame in a flowy flattering manner, but this one is perfect! it is just loose enough and just form accentuating enough that it looks amazing! i am petite with broad shoulders and a large ribcage/short torso, so flowy is a tough one for me.",0

98,38,Cute blouse,,0
98,38,Goes with everything!,"I love this top. i got it thinking i'd wear it mostly with jeans but turns out i have worn it with a lot more. it pairs great with cut-off shorts, white jeans, denim jeans. i have worn it tucked in with high waisted jeans for a more polished look and also un-tucked for a more casual look. i get lots of compliments on this top when i wear it. i think it could be worn into fall with a jacket over it. very happy with it!",0

98,39,Cute yet super wrinkly,"Super cut but easily wrinkles. eg. i ironed it, got dressed, then bent down to tie my daughters shoe and the whole front bottom was super wrinkly. i thought that it'd go away but it didn't... just got worse by the time i got out of my car at work... front and back were noticeably wrinkled all day.",3
98,39,Love it!,I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i can't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.,2

98,39,,"I've got a bit of a love/hate relationship with this top. the fabric feels a little odd and wrinkles crazy hard, and i'm not a fan of the open ladder ribbon over the bust (really? who needs to see the top of my bra?). but i love love love the overall fit, the details (like the polka dot trim and the sheer tucks) and the color (blue green). it looks good tucked in or loose, and i can layer it under cardigans and jackets. i'll get a matching ribbon and sew it in under the ladder ribbon so it's act",19

98,42,Could have been cute...,"The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.

i put on the size 12 & it fit gorgeously. the fabric is a bit stiff and bulky- but i think that's so it holds its shape. first thing i went into my living room & began twirling around.

i am 5'5"" 150lbs. athletic build. the sizing is true to tracy reese. i'll need to get the skirt hemmed as it's quite long on me. but- this little gem will be worn",0

101,25,Poor quality,"Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.",16

103,41,Beautiful top,"Lovely silky top (100% poly). i typically look better in more cool tones. this top is neutral enough that i could pull it off. it really has three very pretty, complimentary patterned fabrics. the front v is very deep and the arm holes are quite roomy so either size down or plan on wearing a cami to conceal cleavage and bra.",5
103,41,Fit,"I loved the design and light weight quality. reference i'm 5'4, 125..i ordered a small, it's a tad big but i can handle it. because of the neck line, you must wear a strapless bra.",0
103,41,Flattering details,I love the fit and feel of this shirt. the fit is narrow but true to size. the stitching details are beautiful and make this shirt really versatile.,0
103,41,,"This is a soft, comfortable shirt. it fits like a t-shirt should. i usually buy m but based on other reviews i purchased s. the fit on me in size small is similar to the model in the photo.",2
103,43,Winner,"There's not much to add to what reviewers have said. beautiful, flowing, light-weight fabric. flattering cut. gorgeous ombre tone with feminine embroidery. a great shirt for hanging out of dressing up. this is one of those shirts you expect from retailer. you wouldn't find it anywhere else.

i've had this shirt a couple of months now and have to note that even with careful treatment, some of the embroidery is coming loose. it's gotten to the point that i want save it for special occasions rather t",1
103,44,Runs huge!,"I bought the tiny brand ""cassia"" tank last week in a small, and it fits beautifully. i ordered this ""sorcha"" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another.",4
103,45,Too small,,0
103,45,Very simple little sweater,I bought this to go with the pants they had online & i love them together. the sweater seems thin for the price but i still love it.,2
103,46,Pretty top,"The only reason i gave this top a 4 star, is that it didn't have enough room around the bust area. i'm a d cup, and the front didn't button properly. but for the price i paid (40% off sale price), i have no coplaints.
i would recommend.",0
103,46,Very low cut...and a weird snap,"Love tiny. i am 5'7"", 125-128 lbs depending on the day, and a 34a. i also have a very long torso, and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one, however, was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated, so it looked boxy on me. however, the worst part was the placket. the description doesn't note that it's held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo, and then",1
103,47,Beautiful but too small for me!,"Usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me!  and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work.  i'm a 34d and it
was way too small in the chest area.  it is a beautiful shirt though and i'm very sad that i have to return it.  it will work better on someone else for sure.  so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine!",1
103,47,Beautiful colors,"This is such a pretty top and a great multi-season piece. i love the colors and pattern, and the cut is flattering. it's not too low cut in the front which is nice. it is woven on the front/sleeves and knit in the back so i'm a little nervous about how it will wash. i usually wear a m in retailer tops and a l in tiny (they usually are truly tiny) but in this tiny a m was good.",6
103,47,Beautiful detail,I love this blouse with a pair of jeans. the neckline is fairly deep but very flattering and feminine. the detail is beautiful.,0

103,48,Think i'll like it,"Pretty color.
love the lace.
my husband thought it looked a little ""old lady-ish"", but i think it depends on what you wear it with....
it's been too hot here to wear yet. i believe it will look great with a cami and leggings!",1
103,49,Delicate and dress up top,"Very pretty and delicate top. it is fresh and with a delicate embroidered ""bib"" style. the fabric on the front is silky and the back is a blend of silk and cotton, just that part (the back) could be a little thicker so more durability. still as it is, it's a niece piece and good quality.
i find it you can wear it with dress pants for office or formal gathering and to dress up jeans and either to leave it our or tuck in. since the bib is focal point you can skip any necklace and war dainty earrin",0
103,51,Perfect!,Bought this top for date night -- something a little special. it's that and also very comfortable. i have broad shoulders and this style accommodates. easy to dress up or down -- perfect!,1

103,54,,"I fell in love with this top when i first saw it on the retailer website and was pleasantly surprised when it was every bit as beautiful in person as it was online (even more so). the bronze colored threads are to die for and the fit is perfect on my 5'4"" (129 lb) 34c frame. if your on the fence on this one, get it. it's worth the purchase!",0
103,54,,"Very unique, cute top. i had to order up a size as i thought it ran a little on the small size.",1
103,55,Top that works with lots of colors,Comfortable and cute. versatile colors that can be worn with virtually anything.,0
103,56,Great shirt,This shirt is more stunning in person. the color is a brighter turquoise than shown & the details are beautiful. fits true to size & is very flattering/slimming. love it!,8
103,56,"Very cute, but tight sleeves","This top is very cute. it looks good with leggings, boyfriend jeans, and flare jeans. be careful, it will shrink. i bought an xs because other reviews said it runs large. it fit great, but i accidentally put it in the dryer and it shrunk. the sleeves that were already were fitted and not loose like the picture shows, shrunk so that they are a little snug on my arms. thankfully, it's still wearable because i do love it and have gotten several compliments on it.",0
103,58,Extremely sheer!,Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.,0
103,58,,"Bought both colors - nice quality top, but they do run large. for reference, i'm 5'4"", 115lbs and xs is still kind of big on me. wish they have xxs.",1
103,59,A true tiny,"I was worried the green might be on the shiny side, but it's not. it's a really nice color for fall and the stitching is gorgeous. like in other tiny tops, this top runs small, so order up a size. in most of retailer tops, i'm a small or medium, but in this, i take a large --- a perfect fit. i'm a 36c. is a little on the pricey side, but got on sale, so all smiles here.",5
103,59,Adorable,"Very flattering and looks much better on than on the mannequin in store. i an in between small/medium and went with medium which was looser in back and did not show any lumps or bumps. great with jeans, pencil skirts and capris .",2
103,59,Poor quality,Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,3
103,60,Beautiful top,"I love this top! it flows nicely and fits perfectly. i'm 5' 4 1/2"", 125 lbs. and ordered the small. i love the little bit of sparkle in the blouse, too.",0

103,65,Casual type dressy,"This blouse is perfect for semi dressy occasions silver ribbon adds a nice, subdued sparkle accent and no need to add a camisole due to the nice lining.",0
103,65,Comfortable and versatile,"The color is perfect for fall.  dressy enough for work, and looks great with a pair of jeans.",1
103,68,Vintage luxury,I just got this at the black friday sale..... i may have passed it by had i not been in an adventurous mood ( i usually wear brighter colors). it feels wonderful....cozy and silky like expensive pjs!! looks very glamorous yet laid back... i feel like i am in a 40's romantic film.. i got a ps and it fits flowy. it was the only one so i was not able to try the xs. love it! it was cold today so i wore a cami under it with lace peeking thru the low neckline .,0
103,70,Lovely embroidery,This garment has the most beautiful and detailed embroidery on the front and across the top of the back. i purchased this blouse in pale pink in a xs for my daughter-in-law who is an retailer fanatic. i am sure she will look stunning in it. my only negative would be the silver accent thread across the front is overkill.,0
104,20,Soft and casual,Love this shirt. i have a bit of a tummy so i usually don't buy shorter shirts but with my high waisted denim and skirts it looks great.,2
104,20,,,0
104,22,Wanted to love,"This is a very lightweight, comfy sweater jacket. i wanted to love but didn't find it ""special"" enough for the price. i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy. the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front. that look was lost on the medium, though the general fit was better. in the end, the looked medium too sloppy for my taste, and the small felt too small.",12
104,23,Nice cardigan,"This is a nice sweater. very soft and while cardigans are not normally flattering on me, i found this one to be slimming. for reference i am 170 lbs 5'8"" and a size medium or 10.",1
104,25,Work of art,The colors of this top are even better in person. the blue is easy to pair with denim and there is no need to accessorize -- the print does all the talking! it is a bit wide on the bottom and the print material is pretty thin. it definitely looks like something not everyone else has - worth the splurge.,15
104,26,Pretty in pink,"Very soft, clean feel. i got this in pink and received so many compliments. perfect to layer on top of your favorite tee or tank. i wish they had it in navy as well.",0

104,33,Looks better in photos- returning immediately,,0
104,33,Much cuter than the picture,"This sweater is so much cuter than the online picture makes it look! i think the model is wearing it too large. anyway, this runs kind of big, so size down. it's kind of short in the front, but it hits at a nice, flattering spot. love it.",5
104,35,Fit is funny.,"Cute details but not happy with the fit. runs wide and short. the peplum fabric on bottom is stiff, wrinkles easily, and lays funny. returning this one.",0
104,35,Lovely!,"I love this top! fits true to size. tunic length, thin comfy fabric, adorable subtle print. the perfect top!",0
104,35,"Pretty shirt, not the right body type","This shirt is beautiful, however i thought that it was made of a softer, lighter material. it is, instead, made of a thick, heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly, i'll be returning it.",0
104,36,Comfy and cute,This cardigan is so fun to wear. you can wear it like as it is shown on this model or turn bottom up and wear upside down as tag suggestion.,0
104,36,Feminine,"This is a beautiful sweater . it's very lightweight and sheer, so best to wear a tank or camisole underneath. also better for warmer months. i ordered the light aqua color and it's lovely.",0
104,36,Retro chic!,"When i saw this sweater, it made me think of the 70's chic trend thats very now but due to the colors (my favorite tones) it would be something i would be reaching for for years to come. i love it combined with jeans but i also worse it over a dress (see photo) - i am wearing it over corey lynn calter floral dress ""paeonia dress"", and i paired it with the ""rosebud layered necklace"". i got two of this sweater as i want to have one for when i wear the first one out :) i am 5'6"", 127 and even thoug",12

104,39,"Beautiful, but runs really big","I typically wear a size xl in retailer clothes. i'm a size 16 in tops and this sweater in xl fit really baggy with no form fitting. it's super soft and i love the color, but it was just unflattering on me.",1
104,39,Cute and fun,"Love the pattern, i thought i would be hosed and need a petite, but the regular xs fits nicely. it is on the thiner side, so great for summer (office is cooold)
love subtle squares, glad they still had my size at sale! :-)",1
104,39,"Gorgeous, well-made sweater",Fits true to size and rides the line between contemporary and retro exceptionally well.,0
104,39,Still debating,I tried on the petite in the store and loved it it's just the color kind of washes me out a bit... nut i did love hte fit and style...,0
104,40,Fun retro fabric,"The sweater is comfortable and has a little 70s fabric flair...not quite as classically modern as it looks on the model. i am keeping it because it is a true fall/spring item. not a fabric weight for summer wear in california. the peach color is pretty muted, so it is not a show-stopping going-out piece.",4
104,40,,"I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine, but i didn't care for how thin it was. there is lining, which i suppose is there to combat the thinness, but it's only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue, it wouldn't have been so bad.",0
104,41,Business in front; party in the back,"I tried this sweater on in-store in grey. from front it appears like a nice, normal sweater, even a little boring. but the side and back are *wow* really fun! the colors and swing of the back material look great, especially with jeans. the front is short, making you wonder if it's supposed to be a crop top. also, the style of the sweater lets isn't very warm because the back is so loose and flowy. i couldn't decide whether to buy it or not. maybe i will wait for a sale.",0
104,41,Great design!,"Just purchased this lovely sweater over the weekend during the 25% off sale. i went in to buy the rona sweater in grey (which i think is the same style with different name) but it was all sold out! the sa pointed me to a rack of these sweaters and i am happy with this choice! the back print is really cute and the sweater design and color is very flattering. it goes well with pants or skirt, and the front is not as short as i had imagined the rona sweater to be.",2
104,42,,"Fit is true to size, color is accurate. love the feel of the knit, it's weightier than if anticipated. i'm looking forward to wearing this to my pnw trips.",1
104,44,Sending this one back,"The photos online make it look like a comfortable, relaxed, lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no ""shimmer"" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out, but it didn't work. it looks too rumpled and i don't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed.",5
104,46,Very cozy & pretty color,I ordered the peach version in size xl. it fit true to size--matched the photos online. i hand washed it and it did shrink a bit. the fabric & knit used are so soft. the color is so pretty too.,0
104,48,"Comfy, soft",,7
104,49,"Fun style, but didn't quite work for me","I tried on the white top at the store. the quality was very good and i loved the overall concept of the design. the dark stripes on the back are slightly raised, giving it a nice texture. the fabric was soft and comfortable. however, the shape just didn't drape as well on me as i had hoped, so ultimately i didn't buy it. perhaps a petite length would have fit me better.",13
104,49,Love it!,"Great quality, fit and fashion! retailer went back to the days of old with this piece and i am so glad! the piece is classic yet modern - real statement without going overboard!",0
104,49,"So soft, but the pieces don't fit","I ordered the pink, and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft, i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater, it just didn't lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just didn't fit right with the outside sweater layer, so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.",0

104,59,A unique design,"I was worried about ordering this top after the first review, but i was very pleasantly surprised. the sweater is a nice weight on the front panel, and a lighter weight knit on the back panel, which gives it a ""flowy"" quality. it looks slender and trim in front, with the unexpected surprise in back. the transition between the front and back panels is well done, which doesn't really show in the photos. i purchased the yellow sweater and had many compliments on it's uniqueness the first time i wor",14

104,62,Scratchy knit!,I so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating. it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo. it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses. i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room. in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves. one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns. the lower,30

105,23,Comfortable pants,The waistband is reminiscent of yoga pants except looser. i think these pants are a little large and wide-legged. i have a bigger butt and i like my pants on the looser side overall so maybe that is why they were super loose on me. i think they are a great way to get away with wearing casual pants when you need to dress up. i feel like they would look best on a taller person. i need to get them hemmed.,1

105,50,Interesting...,"I love the color and the design of this pant....looks very bohemian. it runs large and it has sort of a ""short"" inside of it that is made of a silky polyester...so, it's not as ""loose"" on the inside as you would think. this ""short"" is not a bad thing...but, it's something that is good to know. i love them and will definitely be wearing them very soon...",0

108,25,Cozy but huge,"This coat is really nice and cushy and warm, but it runs very very large. i am about 5'7"", 150 lbs and i ordered a medium and i probably should have ordered an xs because it was ginormous. i returned it in favor of another jacket. i'm sure i would have loved it if it were smaller but i found something i liked more in the interim. it's also a little bit darker in person. just a little bit, i was expected it to be more creme white and it was like a tan.",10
108,27,Well made,This jacket looks great and is well made. the material is very lush however the body of the jacket runs big while the sleeves are tight.,0
108,32,Runs big; comfy jacket!,"Like other reviewers, i did find that this jacket runs big. i am usually a size 2p or an xs and found an xxs in store and fits well. it'll be a great everyday-jacket!",0
108,32,,,0
108,33,Sizing depends on the comor,"I was a bit confused with all the reviews here. some said this runs small and others said it runs big
i decided to go to the store and try it. i'm 5'6 and 112 lbs. i'm usually size 2 or xs.
when i tried the blue one, xs is very tight on the arm and i would have to size up if i ever want to wear a sweater underneath.
however, when i tried the beige one, xs fits me well with some room for sweater.
either one is beautiful. great quality as you would expect from this brand.",0
108,33,,I love this cozy jacket. i wanted a neutral colored jacket for casual outings. this does fit true to size. i am 5' 2'' and 105 pounds. i purchased the xs. you can cuff the sleeves to shorten the length of the arms. it has a piping so it doesn't look odd if cuffed. i do find most things/brands at retailer run big on me but not this item.,0
108,39,"Great, runs small","I love this jacket, but in contrast to the other reviewers find it to run a little small. i usually wear a small at retailer and got a size medium as the small was a little tight under the armpits. this might be because i have a large chest, but i wanted more room in case i want to layer.",10

109,25,,"Saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on. so lovely! i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person. it's like a muted blue that makes it so versatile. the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering. the safety pin is such a unique touch. it's nice and warm, just not super soft, but not scratchy. i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily.",2
109,31,,"Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo, this sweater is a faded, boring, teal-green. what a huge disappointment.",0

109,35,"Great consept, didn't work on me","I really liked this cardigan when i saw it today. the cut and detail in the back is slimming and very flattering. i love the idea of the safety pin closure, and i really like how the model wears it in this photo-open with the pin on the side. when i saw this in-store, it was closed in the front with the pin, which i also like. i thought for sure the cardigan was also pinned in back when i saw it in the model, so it looked fantastic. however, when i tried it on myself, it wasn't quite the same.",17

109,57,,"I agree with the last reviewer this is a great cozy sweater. i took an xs regular and i am 5'6"" 108lbs. the pin is used to close the sweater (no button). plenty of hand-knit sweater vests,wraps,shawls come with or are given with pins for closure. you will find many uses for the pin but as it is shown in the photo..... not likely.",2

110,26,Love and hate.,"This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking, the modern and structured style, and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it, and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby, the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref",0
110,31,A new staple for my wardrobe,"Love this vest! the color looks a little more brown in the picture than it really is--it's a deep forest green that goes great with jeans or black pants. a great piece for polished but casual style, and the fabric has a nice, soft suede-like finish.

if only the was *slightly* higher to hit my true natural waist, it would get that fifth star (but sometimes i wear petite sizes, so that might be the issue here--still looks good tied).",0
110,32,Almost perfect,"Out 6 items i purchased online, this is only one that made the cut. it's super soft and cute on. the only thing i didn't like was the cute lining is attached by buttons, but it needs more attachment points to keep it from showing. i'm going to fix that myself, but i hate sewing things that i purchase. so it lost a star for that.",0

110,33,Deba vest,"First, this vest is made by elevenses. i love this menswear inspired vest. it's simple and structured, however, it's long on my 5'2 frame. the price is also a little steep, but it will add a nice touch to a simple outfit. i plan on taking this to a tailor to take an inch or two off the bottom.",6
110,35,Fab jacket,"This jacket is the best. i'm trying to step up my work wardrobe game while still maintaining some personality and this blazer fits the bill. it's soft, structured, and best part: the hoodie insert is removable. for reference, i'm 5'4"", 128 lbs and the small fit perfectly.",0
110,36,Stylish and versatile!,"I love this vest! there are so many ways to style it...open or tied closed, over a dress or with a tshirt and jeans. i get compliments every time i wear it. it's soft and light enough to add interest to an outfit without being too heavy/hot to wear all day.",0
110,37,Cool vest,Just got this vest in my store yesterday and i was immediately drawn to it. the outside of the vest is this thick knit in an oatmeal color and a bright cobalt blue (even brighter than it appears online). the inside is a jersey knit fabric in grey. its an eye catcher for sure. i knew i needed to try it on. the vest is longer in length (like it appears in the photos). my only gripe is the fit. its great around the neck...nice and full. but i wish the body of the vest was larger. it fits very much,2

110,38,Perfect transitional 3rd piece,"I love this little vest! such an easy outfit completer. just throw it on over jeans and a tank or long sleeves and voila...effortlessly chic! the colors pop and it's the perfect length. if you're on the fence with this one, definitely give it a try. you won't be disappointed!",0
110,41,"Great quality, structured vest","This vest looks exactly as in pictures which is a good thing for online exclusives. i love the fact that it's lined and the texture and color of the fabric is very nice. has a good, solid quality feel to it. it does not have any buttons or belt that comes with it but looks perfectly fine just left opened. i wore it with belt as well and it add to the structured styling of the vest. more on the conservative side of retailer.",3

110,63,,Great look and you can wear this vest with almost everything . i normally wear a small but they only had mediums and it fit fine( i like it tied). this will stay in my closet all year round . it does look like it will wrinkle easily but that doesn't bother me . a must buy !,0
111,27,Poor fit,The fit of this sweater did not flatter my body-type. the top half did not fit well; the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward.,0
111,29,Not made right,"This has such awful proportions. i'm 5'0 and 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite (in the neutral color). the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust!! it looks very unflattering, and it's very pronounced. i'm only 5'0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me. below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it's sewed, and it balloons outward and is very square from there down. very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi",26
111,29,Waaaaay too much fabric,"I know this is supposed to look oversized, and i own a few oversized ponchos, but this takes oversized to a whole new level.  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference.  if you are looking for that, it seemed like good qualify.",0
111,31,Still undecided,"Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere, it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said, you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.",0
111,32,,,0
111,42,Cute sweater,"Don't judge the sweater by the model. it's an unattractive ensemble. the sweater is very pretty on. it's lightweight with a cute design on the back. i wear with skinny jeans or leggings. it runs a bit wide at shoulders but i'm petite so it could just be me. also, it says dry clean i think. but i put in a mesh bag and washed on delicate cycle by itself. then laid flat to dry and it was fine.",0
111,43,Wonderful quality,Received a lot of compliments when i wore this sweater. quality is wonderful. only thing i noticed is that it's a little shorter in length then what i was expecting.,5
111,46,Haven't washed well,"I bought three of these this summer--a mint, ivory, and yellow. when i received them, they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but, then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap, outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside",0

111,56,"Fit was small at waist, large up top! odd spots!","I was so disappointed in this top. the fabric blend was too thick for summer. the cut was wide across the shoulders, and very narrow and short through the waist. add in the odd splashes in the print, and it spelled disaster.

112,34,Nice detailing,"I tried this on in gray while in store, it was the cuff detailing that initially attracted me. once i tried it on there wasn't a lot i loved about it so it didn't leave with me but now that it's on sale, it's the perfect choice. i'm wearing a medium in the photo, and the only real downfall is how long the arms are on me and i have long arms. maybe sizing down would help but i fear i have too much winter weight to hide to take a small. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 145 lbs curvy hourglass, generous hi",25
112,34,Purchased...thought about it...and returned,"I purchased this, and it ended up sitting in my closet for a couple of weeks. i bought it in the green, and i felt it did nothing to enhance my figure. it's kind of a boring design. i like the cowl neck (rare on a tunic) and the sleeve details. the colors don't seem to go well with standard black leggings. overall, unimpressed.",0

113,26,Not great for smaller chests,"The fabric is lovely, color was great, but unfortunately it ran a bit large. this might be a case of girls with boobs vs. girls without. i have a small chest so for me, this just didn't stay in place. i was worried about the arms squeezing me so i got a small rather than my usual xs. bad choice. the diamond in the middle pooches out rather than hugging your body (which was what i was hoping for). when i raise my arms the whole shirt ends up riding up. pretty awkward. there's also a lot of fabric",0

113,39,Love it so much i got both,"I loved the print on both, but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel. i went ahead and ordered the cat one today. the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit, size down. for myself, m was perfect since i'm built larger and broader on top. the top is a bit long, covers my hips and some of my bottom. it's a mixed fabric design, so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types.",0

113,70,Not for me,I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn't work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld's pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer's return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc.,0
113,71,Useful top,"I love this, despite the split sleeves. the day it arrived i paired it with a black boucle midi skirt (from retailer) jewelry and mid high black slings and we to out to dinner with friends. several people complimented me so it must have looked as i'd hoped. i have worn it one other time with straight legged pants and a cashmere cardigan and felt comfortable and a bit more dressed up than usual slacks, jeans and shirts. it is soft, feminine and comfortable...the ubiquitous ""dress it up or dress it",0
113,72,Love this tank!,"In love with this. as soon as i received it in the mail i ordered another color. super soft and easy to wear. i imagine i will live in this top the rest of the summer. felt pricey, but worth it for as much wear as i will get out of it. i am 5'10, 160 and the large is a great fit. perfect fit on the shoulders and just a hair loose throughout the rest of the tank, which is what i wanted.",1
113,73,Cool for every figure,"This is a great top, not cheap but funky! it would look nice on any figure. the two blacks on my top are more alike than the picture shows. great value for a pretty party top - but it can go anywhere!",1
113,74,Classy,Bought this blouse in white. fits great. can be worn with many things. dressed up or down.,1
114,27,Great skirt,,0
114,28,"High hopes, but tiny and flimsy","I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition, the ""brocade"" is a very lightweight polyestery, tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted, it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me, not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past, including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews, but have no regret",0

114,34,A winner; better than the posy maxi sweater dress!,"I tried this in the store a few weeks ago when it just came out because i loved the neutral design and look of it and came back the following week to purchase it with my discount code because it really is worth it...
_______
pros:
- true a-line silhouette. if you have curves and hips like i do (5'9, 36c, hourglass, 165 lbs), then this skirt will flatter you completely. there's a lovely swing to the dress and it drapes wonderfully because it's a thicker fabric.
- runs tts. i can normally wear",5
114,37,Easy skirt,I really like the skirt! it's very comfortable and i can wear it with  so many colors.,0
114,39,Lovely classic,"I love this skirt, wanted to order it from the moment it was new and took em a while to decide to do so (when i saw it was almost sold out in my size, which it is now). another thing is it doesn't come in petite - boohoo.
anyway, ordered the 0 (smallest size) for my 26.5 in waist - didn't have any trouble with the waist being too tight, like some other reviewers. it fit really well and comfortably. sits at the natural waist, so the hem isn't too crazy low on me. fine for heels (would be so cute",0
114,40,Beautiful but fragile,"This skirt is gorgeous- the picture doesn't do it justice. it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material. i received tons of compliments on it. the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily. in a short 2 hours of wearing it, the material was already pulled in two different places. i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time.",3
114,40,,"I returned this one. i usually love cecilia prado? s artistic textiles and was very happy with her floraknit dress, but this skirt was a disappointment . it simply looks different from the picture : it?s way more shimmery- metallic in person, (which i could see a lot of customers actually loved), but to me it made it look cheap. also it lacks structure: the a-shape looks drab on this knit fabric.",7
114,43,Not as shown,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice, the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price...",5
114,45,Great skirt!,"This is a throw it on and you're cute.  so easy and comfy, requires barely any styling to look cute in this.  and it has pockets!",0
114,46,A little bit tough.......and comfortable,"I have a number of mother denim items (jeans, skirts, etc) in a variety of sizes and, unfortunately, i find mother sizing very inconsistent. this skirt is no exception! it is, as expected, high quality: primarily cotton with a fair amount of stretch; very soft; frayed at both the hem and the waistband; and, it runs a little small, i have another mother pencil skirt in a size smaller that is actually wider than this skirt; still not sure if i'lll keep it.",3
114,50,Misleading colors,"This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice, the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.",1
114,52,Unique casual,"I have featured photos below. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs and 34 d. i purchased a small petite. the fabric is cotton, i thought it would be rayon. it is lined with cotton fabric. the skirt has major poof. it falls like a midi on a petite. the waist runs high, which can not be a  good thing for a busty gal. why do i love it? the pattern is one of a kind. the colors are so fall. i wore a vest to accomplish a tapered look. i can't resist this skirt. if your tall, this is a dream. if your petite, you can",0
114,54,,"Pros. 1) the color and texture of this skirt are gorgeous. twice as pretty as the photo .
2) you could wear this with almost any color top, black boots and youve got a great outfit!
3) the black side panels make this a very figure flattering skirt.

cons
this skirt is unlined. because it's a knit skirt on some mesh it's slightly seethrough. i'll wear it with a slip, but seriously for this price it should be lined",1
114,56,Whimsy with flair,"Reviewers may be right that this skirt runs large but it fit well on my waist. it does not come in petite so petite buyers should be aware that it will be more of a midi than a knee-length skirt. it is adorable. i love it especially for its whimsical design of birds, and the colors are deep and lovely with the red popping out more than it does in the picture.the fabric is heavy but there is a slight give to it, which helps with the waist. it's a keeper.",3
114,57,Better even than the picture,This skirt is shimmery without being too much. rich colors and perfect fit tts nice elastic middle so comfortable and gorgeous.,1
114,59,So tweet!!,"I love this skirt! i know others have thought it frumpy, maybe it's because i'm so long waisted but this skirt is perfect for me! not too long not too short but just right! the fabric print is beautiful a mix of muted and bright colors. the fabric quality is nice but nothing overly outstanding. still i'm glad i ordered it before it was gone!",0
114,62,Skirt of the season,"When i saw this skirt on line, i wasn't impressed--especially at the price. but then i saw it in the store and i had to have it! it's beautiful. definitely a colder weather skirt due to the nice weight of the fabric. the colors are lovely and subtle, with a little sheen, ensuring you can wear it with many tops and for many occasions, from everyday to dressier. length is just at the bottom of the knee for me (5'7""), with a flattering and comfortable cut.",0
114,66,So cute but not on me,,0
115,21,Perfect for everyday,"I absolutely love this shirt. it's so easily dressed up and is still really cute just on top of black pants and flats. great for the holiday season too! i am normally a size medium in all tops, i am 5'8'', 150 lbs, athletic-built and the medium is perfect. true to size, definitely recommend!!",1
115,22,Unique spin to classic button down,I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but hadn't found any that caught my eye. leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look. i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist. i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style.,0
115,24,I don't want no scrubs...,Do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub. i think with this top the styling is key. the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasn't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go. anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didn't seem to be static prone,1
115,26,Beautiful tunic!,"I am absolutely addicted to tunics. so, when i saw this on sale, with an extra 30% off, i went for it. i'm glad i did! it's absolutely beautiful. i love the opposing stripe patterns, the hi-lo feature (very subtle), and the tie back. so cute!

if you're petite like me, though, you may want to wear something underneath--it does cut a bit low in the chest area.",0
115,26,Gorgeous print poor fit,"I saw this top in the box and was excited to try it on. the print is absolutely stunning and gorgeous, i could not wait. when i tried it on, it is such a loose top and a tad short. it was flowy all over. i expected it to be loose from the picture but not like this. it would work best on a very slender figure with white pants or leggings. i don't recommend it for a curvy figure, just not flattering. makes everything look big. what a waste because the print is so nice.",0
115,26,,,0
115,27,Maeve never disappoints!,"This is sure to become my favorite shirt! this shirt is feminine and the fit is perfect. the white lace is strategically placed, so you do not have to wear a cami on those hot summer days, but you can for the work day. i cannot wait to wear this!!",0
115,27,Super soft,"Super light and soft. haven't worn it out but expect to wear with jeans. it will be cute and comfy. i'm 5'2"", 130 lbs and bought a small, fits well.",1

115,31,Favorite new plaid,"I purchased this top during the 20% off sale and i'm very pleased with it. i love how flowy it is without looking like a maternity top. for reference, i'm 5'4, 130# and purchased a small (my usual retailer size). if you have broad shoulders you may have to size up as i found the arms and shoulders to run a little small.",3
115,31,Gorgeous top,,0
115,31,,Loved this top when i received it. unfortunately it runs very big. i ordered a small because it had come up but in reality i need an x small and maybe even that would be too big. im 130 pounds and 34dd. its a nice shirt just a little expensive.,5
115,33,Delicate yet boxy,"Lovely blouse-- very well made. i had a baby last year and recently weaned so my bust line is changing-- right now somewhere between a 36d and c. the medium was a little roomy for, i could've easily sized down but i like the airy look so i think i will keep it this size. quality fabric, very comfortable yet dressy. i'd definitely recommend this blouse.",1
115,33,Shrank when washed,"I loved this tunic the first time i wore it. i ordered it in the red and it was very flattering on my post-pregnancy figure and extremely cute with leggings and boots - just what i wanted. it fit true to size, even with a few extra pounds around the chest area. imagine my horror when i pulled it out of the wash - having followed the directions on the tag exactly - and discovered it had shrunk and no longer fit properly. in particular the sleeves became incredibly, uncomfortably tight and much sh",3
115,33,This is the best shirt!,I got this shirt 2 weeks ago and have already worn it 4 times! i love it and every time i wear it i get compliments on it. it is so flattering with jeans or nice fitted black pants. if you are wavering about getting this shirt.... get it. i promise you will love it.,0
115,34,Cute and comfy,"This is a heavier weight shirt. it is fitted through the bust and shoulders and very loose below so, if you don't like loose fitting clothes, this is not for you. it is well made and looks cute with jeans.",1
115,34,Cute fall/holiday top,"Love this top! the quality is great and the pattern is even cuter in person. i'm 5'4"", 125 lbs and bought my normal size s which fits perfectly. it's pretty flouncy and roomy, which is nice because it hides my post-baby tummy. especially love how the back covers my bottom which means i can wear my skinny black leggings underneath. definitely recommend!",1
115,34,Cute plaid top with a feminine cut,"I like the color and the plaid pattern on this top. the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite, i bought the regular length to pair with tights. it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me. i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go. the material also doesn't feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made. it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece, as many reviewers have n",1
115,34,,"A bit wide in the torso, but the detail at the bottom of shirt makes up for it.",0
115,36,,Got this shirt in the green color. it's long and flowy and fits true to size. super comfy.,0
115,37,Perfect fit for broad shoulders,"Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium. i have fairly broad shoulders, and thought i might not fit my usual small (if it helps for reference, i am 5'6"", 123 lbs, and wear a 32c bra). i first tried on the small and didn't even bother opening the medium. i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust (i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size). with this blouse the buttons don't pull at a",0
115,38,"Beautifully made, quality top","I fell in love with this top on the spot and paid full price for it, which is a rarity, since everything goes on sale. it's a beautify top, well made and sits well on me. i am 5'6"", usually wear a size 10 but got away with an 8 in this one. i do have short torso, so i can see it having a problem for someone with long torso or someone who's tall. what's even better is that it went on sale and the store was nice enough to give me the difference back. i'm thinking about getting the other two colors",3
115,38,Lovely top; size down,"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and to be frank sometimes some of the xl are too fitted and i return them. i bought this blouse in size large and it fits loose everywhere. it drapes very nicely in the front and back, and the arms fit loose. i'm making a point to say this to let people know to size down. 
-
i was concerned this blouse might be too short because it looks very short on the model, but for me it hits at a nice length; i have a short waist and am busty. the lace doesn't hit my neck",8
115,38,,What a great top!! unusual design,0
115,39,Nice enough,"I had been looking for an off the shoulder top (or open shoulder) as the trend is really in right now, but that proves more difficult for me (muscular traps and shoulders, not always flattering)... anyway, i decided to order this ( i saw it paired with a wide-leg jeans, tucked in)... that is how i like it... tucked in. it is otherwise a little boxy on me (wide shoulders means the whole thing shifts out. the fabric si a tiny bit wrinkle-prone, but not too badly. both colors are nice, but thought",1
115,39,Surprisingly nice in person,"/my friend and i both tried on this shirt just to see how it fit and because it was blue. we were surprised how pretty it si on. a little see-through though, but hte cut hits in the right places (i guess we are not too endowed). she ended up buying it so i passed but very feminie work piece.",0
115,40,,,6
115,42,Wanted to love it,"Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don't know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain, not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn't even the same material as the front. it's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand, this was just a quality control oversight i guess.",2
115,42,"Yeh, what she said.....","Yep. this is snug, so maybe you might consider upping your normal size. but here's the annoying thing for me...the buttons fell off. not kidding. the first i wore this blouse and two buttons came off. when i looked at the other ones i saw that they all needed to be resewn to keep them attached. what a bother. but i'm doing it because the cotton poplin is nice and the little ruffle is a nice touch that i really like . where am i going to find another? so i'll fix it up the way it should have been",1
115,43,Very flattering fit,"Love this shirt, very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric, but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra.",0

115,45,Perfect,"Received this shirt yesterday and loved it. doesn't look that great online in pics, but it is a unique and beautiful top. the material is a substantial woven cotton so it lays nicely and keeps its shape . i am 5'5 and 128lbs and a small bust size 34a , i usually wear small in shirts but since it is a longer length i didn't want it to tight around my butt.... i am curvy in that area size 6 pants....i ordered the medium and i am so glad i did .. it lifts just like on the model...the only downfall",2
115,49,,"This top is very cute. it is a high low top that i wasn't expecting, but love it. the picture doesn't do it justice it fits closer to the body than on model. fits true to size usually a small and this one fits well in small. got at a ridiculous price which is an added bonus. will get a lot of wear out of this top.",2
115,53,Not flattering on me,Fits like a maternity top. not for my age group or build.,0

115,57,I lovethis blouse,"I hesitated to buy this after reading the earlier review, but went ahead anyhow, and am glad i did! i ordered the white in a small petite, and it is as cute as can be. it is crisp and true white, not off- white. there is a large pleat on one side of the front to give the blouse some interest, and there are openings on each side which allow the blouse to swing a bit but do not open up to reveal skin. it is not long, but by no means is it cropped. it is really sweet with slim jeans or slim printed",4
115,58,,I purchased the blue & white pattern of this shirt. the color blue was bright and contrasted perfectly with the white color in the square design. this shirt worn with a white pair of slacks or a white skirt makes a perfect presentation for any occassion during the warm spring and summer months. the fit of the shirt was true to size. i love the longer length of this shirt because it elongates one's height. the cuffed sleeves are perfect in length. the classic style of this shirt guarantees many y,0

115,59,,This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.,9
115,60,Color is spectacular!,,0
115,62,Gorgeous,"Gosh, this is a beauty! maeve can be a little iffy on sizing, but i find this to fit tts. beautiful details, fit is comfortable yet elegant, nice length...i have zero complaints on this. it is sheer enough to need something underneath, but the fabric is lightweight enough that the extra layer doesn't seem bothersome. nice quality piece (not overly delicate despite the lacy details and sheerish fabric).",5
115,62,Great basic,I really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it's a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater.,1
115,64,Amnesty hi-lo tunic:,I bought the blue & white one and it is so very comfortable! it will look with my blue jeans and in the summer with my white leggings! great quality at a good price.,1
115,65,Loved the blouse,"But it runs super small. i wear a medium for everything but couldn't come close to buttoning this. the buttons were about 4 inches apart (horizontally)

probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit. the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires ""truth in sizing""",0

116,27,So much better irl,"When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it, upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places, the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!",0
116,31,Cute and comfy,This is a real cute vest that is also soft and comfy to wear. love it!,0
116,31,Nice material with some stretch,"I found this to fit really well and i've got a chest, and the hourglass to go with it. the stretch really helps it to be comfortable too. i reckon it's pretty versatile too.",2

116,33,Perfect,,0
116,33,So great,"This is quite possibly the greatest jacket of all time. i ordered it with the ""layered luna dress"" in grey, and i am now giddy with excitement to wear the combo! very chic. i am confident this will be a staple in the years to come. for reference, i ordered my normal size xs (5'5, 115 lbs, muscular) and did not find it to be too tight in the arms (and i have fairly broad shoulders). i did not try it on with long sleeves, but i still think there would be adequate room.",1
116,33,Very chic,"I love this jacket over a dress! it's snug fitting so can't wear anything bulky under it, but super stylish and comfy stretchy material. it's a bit pricey but i get a lot of wear out of it so worth it to me.",0
116,35,Flattering jacket: size up,"This is my third marrakech jacket in as many months. i love it! i was hesitant to order it because of the beige color. luckily it is more of a green beige. it is a very flattering jacket and yes, you do want to size up. this jacket is so comfortable i usually leave it on when i get home because i don't want to take it off. i am 5'5"", 34 b and the medium fits great!",1

116,35,Love at first sight,"I knew once i saw this online that i would love it, because of that i almost feel like my review is biased. i have been searching for a jacket like this for awhile. i own the holding horses version from a few years back, but that one is just not fitted enough in the waist for me (even though it has a drawstring waist). this one too has an interior drawstring waist and it is more fitted in the waist giving the feminine appearance i desire. but it's not too tight. i am small up top, 34b but larger",4

116,36,The alternative to the green cargo jacket,I love layering this over basic tees (or graphic ones like the wild west tee) - it adds just the right amount of edge. currently building my pin collection to add on (vintage turquoise and rock music to be exact).,0
116,37,Very versatile,"I purchased this jacket in green, x-small a while back and wasn?t 100% sure about it due to the size. i?m 5?3?, 117 lbs and a 33a and thought it was a little snug so i tried on the small and that was way too big so i kept the xs. i have worn it a few times and it does look great however i can only wear thin tops with it. recently i purchased the black, x-small and this i love. it?s looser then the green so i can get away with thicker tops. 
i do recommend both jackets. they are pricey for what",2
116,37,,"Ordered this in my typical size, xs, and it fits perfectly. the weather hasn?t cooled off enough for me to wear it on a daily basis, but after just trying it on i can say that it fits really nice. the sleeves are a knit material which make them very forgiving and the jacket easy to wear. plus, there is enough room for me to wear a tee-shirt or thin blouse underneath. ordered the slate color and it is a very beautiful neutral, brown that should go with almost anything.",3
116,38,Awesome!,"Love marrakech for their jackets! this piece is wonderful! i usually wear an xs or s in this brand in jackets. i went with an xs as the sleeve are a little loose. the body still fits buttoned up- nice and tailored. the stretch keeps in comfy with the tailored fit in the trunk. looks great worn open too. i think the best part is the cut and material. i am 5 '4 and 125 lbs, curvy.",1
116,39,Great jacket,"This is a great jacket for fall layering. love the color and cut. it wasn't appearing to me in the photo that the sleeves were knit, but it actually works. i wear the sleeves pushed up as i have really long arms and they are a smidge short. now my go too for casual work days and weekend wear.",0
116,40,Love. this. jacket.,I live in los angeles and this is the perfect beginning of fall jacket! i've worn it with dresses and with jeans. definitely has enough extra room to slip a hoodie or small seater on underneath when it gets colder. it's soft and stylish. the only downside is that the pockets aren't really deep enough to put anything in.,5
116,42,Perfect for all seasons,I ordered my usual size-small. it is perfect because it has enough room to fit a thin shirt or turtleneck underneath when the weather is cooler. the material is very soft. looking forward to a lot of wear out of this vest.,1

116,44,"Shirt and or jacket, with a flair","I dig this jacket very much because i can wear it like a thick shirt or as a jacket, and the removable collar gives even more versatility. i am short so i opted for regular xs (i'm 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), the bit of spandex stretch helps me achieve the fitted look without looking too tight. i love military green color, it's a happier neutral than black or brown. without saying, it goes with everything and flatters all body types.",0
116,45,Really versatile little jacket,"I saw this in store, but they didn't have my size and i balked at the price. however, i kept thinking about it and once i received it from online i now think it's well worth it. the quality is very nice and it fits tts. i like that the arm materials is stretchy. i've worn this with jeans, but will also wear it with a skirt to the office. it's got enough weight to function as a light spring jacket. the color matches the photo and is a nice neutral to go with many things.",1

116,56,Cool military jacket,"This is such a cool military jacket. when i saw it displayed on a table at my local retailer, i knew it was going home with me. this is my 4th marrakech jacket, i love their style. i bought the black in my usual size large, and i agree with the previous reviewer, if you have a chest this is a very flattering jacket. i usually wear my jackets open, and i discovered that if you button back the lapels at the second button down it looks amazing and not so sloppy. it kind of bothered me the way",2

116,61,Perfect jacket!!,"This is the jacket i've been looking for! i love the collar/lapels - they can lay flat or be worn up a bit. the material is really soft so the jacket is comfy and soft. the sleeves are of a ribbed material that makes the jacket even softer and more comfy. i got the black but it's really more of a charcoal black vs. jet black. the color/dye is saturated and dense so there is no sheen to the material ensures that it will be colorfast. when zipped it's form fitting but not tight (tts - i'm 120 lbs,",6
116,70,Great quality,The malabar moto vest is made of a beautifully soft fabric and is lined on the inside. the added details - pockets and epaulets - are a plus. the vest has snaps and a zipper. the length is just right and the vest has a flattering shape.,1

117,38,Good idea...execution could be better,"For reference, i'm 113 lbs, with a short torso so i was thrilled when i saw this jacket on-line. i was expecting a soft, comfortable and polished piece. i tried on a standard size xs and the color of the khaki is muted on line, it's a little darker in person and the finishings like zipper plackets are much lighter in contrast. also, it is a ""mixed-media/material"" type. for example, it's linen with soft leather accents, which also have varying tones on the inside of the collar, on the wrist area,",9

117,51,Amazingly wonderful jacket,"First, i must agree with the other reviewers who said that this jacket is short, because, well, it is. that being said, it is a perfect length for someone who is petite, like me. i am not a fan of lengthy tops or jackets, which tend to make my short body look like a blob. i love the length (or shortness) of this jacket! aside from that it fits true to size, is wonderfully warm and cozy, and makes me feel fabulous when i'm wearing it. it is my new favorite jacket!! :)",0

117,56,Great plaid!,"This vest is very warm and soft. it is actually a fleece that almost appears as wool. the plaid is beautiful-a pretty soft pink with the black and charcoal colors. i ordered a size large and the fit is okay. an xl would have been too big under the arms and in the bust area however, i would have liked it a little looser in the bottom half. i kept the large as there is no closure to the vest. it just hangs open.",1

118,20,Simple and cute dress,I found this in the returned section of the store in a large. i am normally a m but the fit would have been too small in the shoulders. it is very light weight and the color is much lighter in person which means it will go right into spring!,0

only complaint about the dress is the slit. it does not go as high like on the model, stops right at the knee.the cross over is not too revealing (which is nice). overall the fit is great! im 5&#39;6 and usually size 12 and 36dd, the large was perfect!",0
118,25,Flattering and fun!,"Ordered this dress online, and i love it! i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for. the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist, but for the most part, the dress fit very well and was very flattering, may just need a little bit of ironing. i am 5'9 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips, and",9

118,39,Pretty pleasing,Very pleased with this vibrant and colorful sweater dress. the color combinations are very beautiful and it seems as if the threads used have an inherent shimmer. the fit is body skimming without highlighting trouble spots. i am a m/l on top and a s/m on bottom and the size medium fits perfectly. the cut adds the illusion of proportion to my disproportionate body. there are some problems but workable: slip is sewn-in which i wish was detachable; the scoop neck is too low for my 36ddd bust; weave,0

118,40,Great on-trent dress!,"I bought this dress because i love the cut-out shoulder look and had been wanting to find something with this trend that i'd feel comfortable wearing. the dress fits well and the shoulder cut-out gives it a trendy look. i love the classic navy color. i was originally hesitant to buy it because of the slub material - which i've always thought to be a cheaper, thin cotton. the slub is more substantial than other slub tops i've seen elsewhere, so i was happy about that. still, it is made with slub",6

118,46,Gorgeous colors!,This dress is beautiful on so many levels. the colors and print are amazing and the maxi sweater dress idea is unique. it fits true to size and is very flattering. my only issue is the amount of shine that it has from the metallic threads running through it. i would have preferred less shine which would make the dress more versatile.,0

120,27,Beautiful on!,"I saw this dress online and fell in love with it. it is just as beautiful in person too. very delicate, but receive so many compliments every time i wear. it is two separate pieces, a slip dress and the overlying fringe dress. i am 5'4"" and need a 2 inch wedge heel to keep the bottom from dragging. probably could have tried to order the petite but figured i'd probably be wearing heals anyway. i normally wear a 6/8 in dresses and the medium fit perfectly and is so flattering! the top half is flow",0

120,44,Show your petite customers some love,"I loved the look of this dress the moment i saw it but was ridiculously long. at 5""3 i can usually get away with buying regular length longer dresses and pants with the help of heels if needed but not a chance this time. this dress does not come in petite and the fringed bottom design of the dress would not allow for any type of altering either.",3
120,46,Cool dress!,"This dress is so unique, and is high quality. it came nicely packaged, and unfolded with no wrinkles. i bought it as a cool summer dress for events, and it fits the bill. i wore it once, and received many compliments. the only issue, is that you cannot take even medium size steps wearing this dress. a side slit would have solved the problem, but that would not have deterred me from buying it. the straps for the slip underneath are great, so that i could adjust it so my bra would not show.",2

122,38,Go to summer tank,"This tank i am in love with. the color is great to go with jeans or any color i have in my wardrobe. it works with skinny jeans, culottes or a skirt and perfectly compliments the current shoe styles. my gladiators, summer booties, and my espadrilles are all equally cute with this outfit topper. it is made out of the most beautiful lightweight material and will be great for the 100 degree plus summers that we have here in texas. the bra thing is a bit of a problem because a strapless bra dose not",6

pros:
- great feel on the skin and fabric. this really caught my attention. hard to find a sweater that's breathable for cool summer evenings or mornings.
- color scheme will go with anything, elegant touch.
- unlined making it breathable.
- runs large, forgiving it. stretchy. i'm normally a size 10/12 (m/l)",3
123,34,Perfect for work,"I ordered this blazer so i could look more put-together for work, but still feel comfortable. it checks both of those boxes, (it's almost like a sweatshirt material with more structure) and has a great cut/style. my only word of caution is that i thought this jacket was white with blue stripes, but the white part is actually a light heathered gray. i think i would have preferred white, but i still like it enough to keep. got my normal size small, which fit great.",7
123,36,Dressy casual,"I tried on the grey motif yesterday, and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved, and the only thing i bought. i'm 5'4 34 dd 125 lbs, and the xs was a perfect fit for me. i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms, so i generally wear a small, but i tried on the small, and the arms were a bit baggy. i plan on wearing tanks underneath, so the xs was the right call. if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath, go with your usual size.",2
123,39,Cute,"This vest is cute. the colors are as pictured, and the lace detail on the back is adorable. it is summery and versatile. however, it was really big on me. i usually wear and xs, but it just swallowed me. now i have to consider whether to exchange for an xs petite.",1
123,39,Not structured,,1
123,41,Wish it worked,"I had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo, i even waited for it to come back in stock. the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy. for reference i ordered xs, and i am usually a 0/2 on top (small chested). it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me. so disappointing.",6
123,44,Cute jacket but small,"I really like the look of this jacket, but i think it runs small and i must return the one i received. i am debating about ordering the next size up because it is so cute. it can go with jeans or khakis and bright or white shirt underneath. it seems very versatile. will be a good transition piece between seasons. i also like that it is made in the usa.",2
123,44,Should have read reviews,Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted,0
123,45,Great coat!,"Great coat! lightweight, oversized, yet warm. just enough structure to flatter most body types. i wear an xl/14, but got medium as it's very oversized. light enough to wear with layers. got a million compliments!",0
123,45,Looks great...feels like a sweatshirt!,This is the perfect throw on little blazer-like jacket that feels like a sweatshirt! i loved it so much (on sale) that i bought another one in a different color. i am 5'0'' and 115lbs and the xs fits like a glove. it is so great. well made. so comfortable. versatile. dress it up for work or down with a pair of jeans.,1

123,48,Gorgeous eyelet,"I must be the lone dissenter, but i am in love with this piece! a dark cami underneath really make the eyelet pop. i probably would not have liked it if it did not have the clasp, as it does run wide. however, with skinny jeans or slim pants, this works b/c it's loose in the right ways. it may not be for everyone, but it's one of my faves right now.",1
123,51,"Strange fit, but fun jacket","I really like the look of the jacket and that it is stretching. sizing a bit odd. the xs is pretty snug in the arms, body is fitted. but the small seems 2 sizes larger. the body is very baggy. i kept the xs, but can't wear sleeves underneath!",1

123,57,Great casual blazer,I'm not a blazer girl but this one is perfect in the sense that it's not overly structured and stiff. it is really soft and comfortable but still holds it's shape. i am planning to wear it with a tee shirt and denim or even some leather leggings (pilcro).i can see this being dressed up for work or church. a great piece for your wardrobe. i could have taken a small but decided on the medium in case i wore something a little thicker underneath.,4

124,30,Cute and simple,"Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0"" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top.",0
124,36,Lovely material,These tights are comfortable and the material is great. i bought the gray and holly color and the colors are as shown online. similar to most nylon tights they snag easily. definitely not a legging and similar to other reviewers these won't keep you warm in the winter.,4
124,40,Cozy,"These tights are light but at the same time super cozy. definitely cut and sewn as tights and not meant to be worn as leggings -- they're really sheer around your rump. i've worn them around the house with oversized t-shirts and long sweaters. would only wear out of the house with a dress or serious coverage, despite what i thought when i bought them. i wish they were available in a few more colors. worth the sale price.",0
124,40,Cute and comfy!,"I wear tights all winter. it's difficult to find cute, fashionable tights that aren't ""heavy"" and have quality fabrics that will last through an entire season. these fit great, don't roll or bunch, don't shrink, have great feeling fabric and aren't super thick... but not see thru! love these and plan on purchasing in all of the colors!",0

125,29,Great work blouse,"I bought this blouse in the purple motif and love it for work. great design and print.
based on the existing reviews, i sized down from my normal xs to an xxs and i actually wish that i would have stuck with the xs only because the blouse is tighter on my biceps than i would prefer, but i am keeping the blouse. i always appreciate this in other reviews, so hopefully it helps: i'm 5'2"", 117 lbs, and a small 32b.",3
125,29,,It broke my heart to return this shirt. the pattern is just the kind of quirky that i crave from retailer. the quality is really great but in the end this shirt was just way to big. i don't think the xs would have made enough of a difference. sad face.,0
125,35,Adorable!,"I saw this top at my local store and tried it on a whim. it is so much cuter in person than it looks online - i wouldn't have given it a second look based on these pictures... it perhaps runs a tiny bit large, but i stuck with my usual size small since it hung nicer on my body than the xs did. if you're thin you may want to size down - i have a decent amount of ""padding"" that keeps me from wanting to wear anything fitted (5'4"", 130 lbs). the little dots are more prevalent in person and the peplu",11
125,38,Boxy and runs huge,"I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern, when it arrived i was super confused. it's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos. it's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger. i would say order two sizes down. also it hangs like a maternity shirt. i might order it once it's on sale, which it definitely will be, but even then am not positive i would keep it.",4
125,42,Had such promise,"I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum, cap sleeves, and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately, this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition, the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower, too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.",0
125,43,Cute but not cute enough,"This blouse is a disappointment! it runs so large, it looks ridiculous. the cute is super wide and flared. they must have it pinned on the model. it is not flattering at all. i really thought this could be cute. not worth the money either! it's expensive and ill-fitting. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4.",4

127,41,So cute!,"These are *almost* perfect. the fabric feels great, and it's a super cute print. the only downside is that the rise is really long and high. i wish they'd stocked more petities, because the petites are all sold out, and only the super long regulars are left at this time. if you are above 5'7"", they'll be awesome on you. if you are below 5'4"", you may be getting them altered.",2

128,23,Stunning but has fit issues,"This top is beautiful, the lace is sturdy and intricate and the top drapes perfectly, slimming. but, a word to the wise, the lace does not stretch at all even though the rest of the material does and that coupled with where it is on the bust and back means very limited movement unless you are a size 0 with an narrow back/chest and shoulders. i can't imagine anyone with a cup size larger than a b wearing this. i am 5'5"", 145 lbs and a 34b and always a small or medium and a size 6 for reference. i",93

128,31,Stunning - but not for the faint of heart.,"I'm 5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress. one of these beauties ended up in our store and i had to try it on. the sleeves are no joke - serious bell sleeves that could have looked comical with the polka dots, but is surprisingly chic. the one i purchased was a medium - never had an opportunity to try a small, which i suspect is my actual size. buying it oversized made this magical. it feels modern. i actually think because the whole sweater is oversized on me, it makes the sleeves less cartoonish.",3

128,36,Nice shirt but huge,"Very nice top, like the linen fabric. i ordered my regular size m and its huge. makes me look larger than i am, and i will be returning it. i would like a size s i think, just not a flattering oversize fit for me",0
128,36,Pretty and classic,"This blouse is pretty and drapes wonderfully. i don't think it's too wide at all. it's soft and comfortable. it's stretchy, yet with quality fabric that should keep its shape. definitely a classic piece. the sale price makes the cost more appropriate. the white is a little transparent, but with a tank, it's not a problem. the black is beautiful. i'm having a hard time choosing between them. i love the cut and sleeve details. it wouldn't have looked right with less fabric. it's needed for the sty",0
128,37,Lacy & flowy,"I love the desi blouse! i got it in white and it's a little more off white than pure white, but it is a great flowy top. the touch of lace across the bust is a nice accent. the only down fall is that the sleeves are a bit puffy, but the rest of the top makes up for that.",0
128,37,,"This top is beautiful and i have received so many compliments on it. the fit is very complimenting, and i would continue to wear it often except that the fabric is unraveling. the bottom of the lace has raw edges so i would expect some fraying there but my top is shedding long streaks of material with each wear throughout the entire top, 1-5"" strands of the lace unraveling isn't exactly a great look.",13
128,38,Beautiful top,"It's funny because i coveted this top online for weeks, but looking at the reviews i kept thinking that it would look ridiculous on me. i am very busty and do not like things to cling or be too tight. however when i went into the store today i tried on both the cream and the black in larges, and both fit beautifully. i decided to go with the black just because i thought that i would get more use out of it. i find that it fits well, though perhaps the sleeves because of the elastic are a tad bit",1
128,38,Beautiful; blue looser than black.,"I bought this blouse in black in december of 2015. like other reviewers noted, it has a bit of an odd fit with the lace being a bit constrictive across the bust and raising arms. it wasn't a deal breaker because i loved the look of the blouse. however, i just purchased this blouse in the new color blue in july of 2016 and i'm happy to say the blue color is looser and i have no problems with the lace being constrictive around the bust or arms.

128,38,"Quality blouse, runs very large","I'm an xl in all retailer tops, and sometimes the xl are still too small to fit loosely; i don't like to wear tight clothes. having said that, i had to purchase this top in a size small because it was just cut so large. the sleeves hang a bit odd if you don't get the correct size. i love the feel of the blouse, the fabric is a nice quality. i recommend giving it a try but have patience during the process of figuring out the size that will look best on you in this blouse.",2
128,39,Great buy!,Really great tank. fit runs a little small if you are tall.,1
128,39,Nice enough,"I tried the xs in store (white) though it is sold out online, guess i was lucky... the top is pretty sheer, i could wear it with nothing underneath, like on of the sales people did, however, you can see my innie... like a big shadow. i like the look, it is a little boxy, but feminine at the same time. mine fits wide, like the model, why i put as true to size... if there were still some xxs, i might have ordered it. it is a bit edgy, not romantic as some other pieces i have. overall, i like. the",2

128,42,Awww... so in love!,This is online exclusive so i ordered both sizes xs and s. it runs pretty large so i kept size xs. the material can be stretched. but i like the feeling of it and very comfortable to your skin. i am so happy receiving so many compliments wherever i go!!!,0

128,44,Fabulous and delicate,The perfect summer top. paired with a small tank underneath and jeans and had many compliments!,0
128,44,Great summer top,"Lightweight and comfy fabric, very flattering on, except runs a bit big through the body. i normally wear a 12/14 and a l at most stores, but retailer seems to run large on me, so i needed to exchange this for a smaller size as the fabric width on the body was just too much.",8

128,46,Disappointing!,"The cut is too long and shapeless. if it was cropped, i would have kept it. the beads are delicate as another reviewer has said but i was prepared for that. too bad the fit just wasn't flattering. it's going back.",17
128,47,"Beautiful , romantic","I was hesitant to buy this because some reviews said that if you were busty it would fit tight and awkward across the chest.. i'm petite, 32c, 5ft and purchased the xsp in white .it is gorgeous! it fits a tiny bit big and i think i could have gotten away with a xxsp, but i like the flowiness of this size i have so i'm keeping it. it does not feel tight across the chest at all and hangs beautifully. i love it! the material is gorgeous and it is well made.",0
128,47,,The shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on. sent it back. wouldn't buy even on sale.,0
128,48,Cozy sweater in a boxy style,"This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size, it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).",6

128,51,Better looking on that in the picture,"So this is available in the store in a reddish coral color, see the #your retailer pictures and you'll see someone wearing it under the gray blazer. anyway, i tried it on and the fit was very flattering for a tunic. the front of the sweater hit me just at the waist and the front draped nicely. somehow the back was slightly hugging my back side but not tight or restricted. i ended up ordering the black and navy online because the fit was fantastic and will go with so many things. nothing shee",19
128,52,It really is true to size,"Beautiful blouse - my only complaint is that the lace is too open for my taste. i'm a size small or a 4 for the most part. in retailer i can sometimes wear an xs. i decided to keep the small. yes, it's slightly restricting but i don't notice it much - it's definitely not a straight jacket. i also ordered a medium and in a way it could have worked but there was a lot of extra fabric. i am not flat chested - i wear a 34c - 32d depending on the bra. if you are inbetween sizes like me go with the larg",0
128,53,Boxy and big but pretty material,Another tent-like tee. this shirt is thin but not in a bad way and the color and design are really nice. but...it is really boxy and i'm just tired of that look. the longer sleeves are a plus for fall.,7

i like this top as well because it allows for a normal bra strap, so you feel covered but the sexy shoulders peek out. it also is a bit longer in the back than the front wh",3

128,56,"Feminine, flattering, and comfortable","I love this top, it gives a little bit of a sleeveless look yet is more flattering on the arms for those who don't normally wear sleeveless tops. i think it runs very large - i'm normally a size s/m and the extra small was right. it's loose around the waist yet has a feminine fit.the tiny balls around the neck, button at the back, flutter sleeves, and linen fabric are all cute details that make this top unique. i also like how the fluttering goes down the sides and not just around the sleeve.",9

128,58,Pretty top with chokey neckline,"This top is very pretty and you can definitely wear it without a cami with a nude bra if you're an outgoing person, especially for a summer evening. my only confusion is the too high neckline. if it was just a little lower, it would look and feel less ""chokey."" i keep wanting to pull it down. i'm a size 0 and needed the xxs which fits like most people's xs's as sizing continues to get bigger. really lovely except for the neckline. looks great over white or colored shorts and is a nice mix of cas",1

128,60,Gorgeous,"This shirt is nothing like the online pictures. it's a stunner in person. ended up with the black one though i was torn between it and the white. i would agree with some other reviewers that it has little to no give across the chest so i bought a l due to broad shoulders. the m fit like a glove and i was afraid it might tear if i raised arms or reached for something. not sure if a large busted girl would be comfortable. though i sized up, it didn't affect the way it hangs and it hangs beautifull",0

128,63,Feminine beauty,"Love this top, the lace detailing on it is gorgeous and fits tts. however, the length does run a bit short, not crop top short, but it is shorter than i expected, and i'm s short person.the color is listed as white and as pictured, it also looks white, but it's not. it's definitely an ivory color. i bought a white camisole to wear under it and when the top arrived, the tank didn't match the top.",41
128,63,,Ditto to all of the reviews who state that this top is beautiful but runs small in the bust. i am a large or an xl so i ordered this in the xl. i'm a little broad and busty and it was too small/binding. this is a beautiful well made top for a certain body type.,0
128,65,Soft lace,"The lace on this looks like it would be stiff, but it isn't. it's soft and drapes nicely. i normally buy an xl (if it's not a knit) and so i did. the top will fit up to a size 18 in the xl because it is boxy and generous. it fit me perfectly and just tapered my body. it looks looser in the photo.

it's as see through as the photo. and, i wouldn't wear a cami under it. that defeats the purpose for hot weather imho. i think a nude bra works just fine. you can see the model is wearing a white bra",6
128,66,No go,"I got the black in a medium. it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy. i think it's the angled wide sides. on me, the design just created bulk. nice substantial fabric but it isn't soft or cozy. back it goes",3

129,22,,"This dress is seriously gorgeous, and even more so in person. the cut at the bottom is so flattering for curvy , pear shaped, and hourglass shaped women. i sized down so that the dress gave me more of a waist than you can see on the model and it was so much more flattering. love the fabric, fit and style of this dress.",2

129,23,The worst,"I don't typically write bad reviews, but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me, and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small",2
129,24,Beautiful dress,"This is one of my new favorite dresses!! i ordered this in pink, and think it looks even more gorgeous in person that it does on the model. it's more of a reddish color. the dress hugs my body in a flattering way. i'm a 34b and the dress fits very comfortably, but it might be a tight fit for someone with a larger bust. i'm usually a small for retailer dresses and the small fit like a glove. it is wonderfully flowy and extremely elegant. i can't wait to wear this out!!",4

129,25,Flattering and feminine,"Love everything about this dress except for the elastic waistband. it's a dressier style, and the elastic cheapens the look--definitely needs a ribbon or belt to cover. otherwise the cut and fit is very flattering, the fabric is nice, and the floral pattern is lovely. i found the dress tts (size 4r and i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs).",0

129,26,"Beautiful dress, odd fit","I really wanted to love this dress! the quality is great, and the overall look is so lovely. however, i tried two different sizes (petite s and petite xs) and it still looked too baggy/big. the upper part is wider than it appears. also, the photos shows the bottom two buttons buttoned up. however, the dress doesn't actually have any loop holes or button holes, so it just hangs open. very sad to have to return both dresses.",3
129,26,Do not size up!,"Following the advice of other reviews, i ordered a size larger than normal, since the reviews said runs small in the bust. the dress ended up being much too big everywhere, including the bust.

the dress was beautiful and great quality! sad i ended up with the wrong size.",4
129,26,Not for me,"I love the pattern and style of the dress, but unfortunately, it's doesn't fit quite right. the top is too loose (the clip doesn't work well) and the waist line of the dress sit above the waist. and the sleeves are tight (which is shocking to me because i have skinny arms).",0

129,28,Frumpy and clingy,"The fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy, it was too flimsy, the arms were too wide and overall for $100 this dress didn't cut the mustard. i'm 5'7"" 135 the dress was long enough, just didn't flow very well.",1
129,29,Beautiful summer dress,"I tried this on yesterday in the store because i was drawn by the rich purple color and pretty print. i took my usual size 2 (5'2"", 110 lbs) and while it fit well, it did leave too much room in the bust and around the shoulders/arms. i had the store order me a 2 petite, and am confident that this will help. the shape of the dress is a bit straighter than it appears in the picture and it didn't gather in the waist at all, but i still found it flattering. i'm sure i will get great use out of this",0

129,29,So interesting & unique,"The weight of this denim is perfect, thin enough for a nice drape and wearability for all seasons but still thick enough to be structured. though there is absolutely no stretch, which is probably why so many are finding it to run small. i am a true size 6, but find that most retailer brands run quite large, therefore i usually wear a 4 and that's what i purchased in this dress. the bodice is a bit snug, but not enough to size up, for me personally. i know it's mostly a spring/summer dress,",3

129,29,Weird sleeves,"I so wanted to love this dress, but the bell sleeves were enormous! if you're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool, but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings. the rest of the dress was beautiful, though, and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. i would recommend sizing down, as the dress runs large.",2

129,39,,"I love this dress! it is more of a thick cotton linen than actual denim. it fits true to size in the sense that i am usually a size 6, but i would say it is smaller on top than normal size 6 dresses. i am 5' 8"", small busted, and a ""pear"" shape, so i like the more fitted style of the top with the a-line skirt. i love the length hitting just below the knee. it is flattering for my body type. seems well made and at a good price point.",0

129,40,Great swing dress ... but not for me,"On the hanger, this looks like a great dress .. especially to wear to a hawaii wedding. on me, not quite. 

the bell shape of this dress made it appear that i was carrying extra weight in the middle ... and the shorter length accentuated my big calves.

129,41,Beautiful!,"I bought this dress last week for a wedding next summer. it did not appeal to me on the hanger, but once i tried it on, i was so impressed. the green color is lovely and it is lightweight and airy, and it does have a lining which is a plus. i love the little ruffle sleeves and the tie in the back is perfect. there have been comments about the hemline being awkward but the length on me was perfect and has just the right amount of flounce to be feminine. i can't wait to wear this dress! (i am 5'6""",1
129,41,Cute but not for anyone bigger than a b cup,I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.,30
129,41,How can i add length so i can keep?!!,"Love this dress! it's a little roomy on me & i maybe should have gone with the medium. i'm 5'11"" and about 165 so usually wear a large. my problem is with the length. i knew it was a gamble, but the other color images on the 5'10"" model gave me the hope that the dress would come close to being near my knees ... nope. it's a good 6"" above them, and i couldn't wear this to work. so being the crafty sort, i'm pondering adding a few more lace layers to the hem.",3

129,41,So sad i had to return,"I absolutely loved this dress and when i received it, it was exactly the way it looked/fit online. the material is so pretty and the fit was amazing. it was a bit wrinkled, but i'm used to ironing things, so that didn't bother me. unfortunately, i had to return it though because of the color. i'm filipino, and this yellow just isn't flattering on someone with dark/tan skin. yellow is a tricky color for me to begin with, but this was more of a mustard yellow and just totally wrong for my coloring",0

129,42,Adorable dress,"The picture does not do it justice. this dress is beautiful on. it is fitted on the top and flares on the bottom. it is also a very soft denim. the person helping me at the store brought a sparkly belt that made it even more spectacular. truth is it looks great with or without the belt. it fits true to size (5'4"", 135 lbs and 34c and my usual size 2 was great).",6

129,42,Gorgeous dress,"The dress is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is light, the pattern is not overwhelming and has a zipper on the side to make it more fitted in the waist. the top is blousy, but i am only a c cup and it still was perfect. the bottom has an uneven cut that makes the dress very interesting. i love it. i am usually a size 2 or 4 and the size 4 was perfect.",2
129,42,"Soft, feminine and perfect for summer",Like my title suggests this is lovely and perfect for summer. the lining however is not silk it's rayon and sat weird on me. it offered no coverage on my top and actually is quite useless (i do have a large bust). i have a free people slip that will work and because of that will i'm keeping the dress. the outer shell is silk and really lovely and the colours are true to the picture.,6

129,43,Great transitional piece,"This is a great dress from moving to summer into fall. it's great right now with the warm temps, but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit. it's very comfortable also. there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front. i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through. maybe, you can adjust it at the straps some. at any rate, it's a nice dress and i'm keeping it.",0
129,43,Pretty; low cut arm holes,"Gorgeous fun dress, but the cut in the armholes (6 petite) is really low. so low even a strapless bra peeks above it. there are also lining issues (could have been with just my one choice) where the lining is not stitched well around the armholes so it shows too much. back is stunning. i would say that if you can go bra less this could be so awesome. it didn't work for my body because i have to wear a bra, but i think its a winner for someone.",5

129,46,Great maternity dress,"I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful, both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees, not like shown in the picture here. on that note, i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.",2
129,46,Heavy material,"I love this dress because it is different and unique. i agree with others that the torso runs tight. i got lucky and it still fits snuggly. i think that's the look the upper part should get with the bottom more a-line and flowy. 
it's super cute though. the material is truly jeans material, therefore quite heavy and think. maybe not a dress for summer. more spring or fall with a little sweater.",0
129,46,Jeans dress? oh yes.,"I admit, i did not intend to buy a jean-dress but the cut - i could not pass it up. classic and vintage dress style. the fringy hem and more conservative length is so fun and makes the strapless top stand out. with a stunning necklace this will be a versatile piece. no doubt.",2

129,46,Nice summer dress,"I ordered a size xl in the mango. the fit on me matches the model for the most part so i think it's true-to-size. it looks like it's intended to have a loose, flowier fit throughout the dress. the only confusing part to me is the model is listed as being 5' 9"" and i'm under 5' 6"" yet the length is the same. it fits me at knee-length too. i thought it would hit a little longer based on the model's info for the photos and getting the regular sizing. the one thing i wish was different is to have it",0

133,48,Pretty boho like,"This green dress seemed more fitted and tailored on the model. i ordered a small and medium in the green and mint (even though it says mint, it's a grayish blue). usually i'm a medium but even the small seems a bit big. it fits more like a loose boho dress rather than how the model wears it. the colors are vibrant and the embroidery is nice. i will be keeping both colors in small and just have to accept that the fit is similar to a looser casual summer dress. if you look at the pics that other c",0

133,66,Great casual summer dress (with pockets!),"I don't love this dress but i really like it a lot, hence the four stars. i opted for the light blue. the embroidery is a rich, vibrant blue and quite beautifully done. i am 5' 6"" and 125 lbs. and the xs fits perfectly. it's intended to be a looser cut but it isn't at all frumpy and it hangs nicely. and it has pockets! all around a good summer staple.",2
133,67,This is a keeper,"I just got this dress in the mail, and i have to disagree with the previous reviewer.. the embroidery on the dress is so well done and thick. the material is high quality and although breathable, holds up perfectly to the embroidery.. i usually order an extra small in loose fitting dresses, and ordered the extra small in this one. i'm 5'4"", 117 pounds, with a curvy build. the xs was more fitted, which i wanted. i can belt it or wear it loose. did i mention the color? vibrant rich green. can't wa",16
133,68,Cool ohio,"Just got this dress and am very pleased.  fell in love with the bright color in the store and then came home ordered it at a great sale price!!  color is as shown...beautiful lace trim at the bottom.....back longer than front as described and pockets!!  i am 5'2"" and length on a large comes to just below the knees..in front....i may wear leggings under it...dont like the slip as it is far too tight...will wear a tee or turtle under it..  quality heavier fabric. roomy... linen and cotton.",0
134,21,,"I just purchased this blouse in store! the fabric has a nice weight and drape, feels nice to the touch and is opaque. i'll be wearing this one as a dress and a top. i'm 5'2"" and this fell a couple inches above my knee. i typically wear an xs at retailer and opted to go with a small for the extra length and because i hate when off the shoulder silhouettes pop up and become not so off the shoulder. i laid the xs and small out to compare sizing and didn't notice a major  difference width wise. i typi",4
134,23,Great features but too boxy,I loved the color of the top and the faded look but unfortunately had to return it because it was too boxy and just looked frumpy,0
134,25,"Loved this blouse, just not on me","I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful, and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well, which is not a given for this style top, and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions, and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length, not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs and tried a size s.",0
134,26,Love this top,I paired this top with pants and cardi from retailer and have really enjoyed wearing this outfit. i usually wear a large but due to how much material there is and how flowy it is i sized down to a m and it fits perfectly. only down side is getting the buttons buttoned behind your neck.,1
134,28,,I can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone. i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste. i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake!,4

134,34,A flattering peplum top,"I had been eyeballing this for a very long time because i loved the look of the skirt and this top (of which i snagged the skirt when it went on sale). i was delighted to finally take a chance and buy this when it went on sale, too. thoughts below:
______
pros:
- it is well made and on the thicker side. 
- for a peplum, it is actually slimming. i am an hourglass and with hips, which usually means such tops flare out so much making me look wider in all the wrong places. so i was skeptical abo",0
134,34,Good quality,I was looking for a good navy top for the spring/summer to wear with white denim for a nautical look. this top is perfect and i especially like the neck for when its cooler in the evenings.,0
134,34,Love!,This top is perfect!! i am small chested and it actually makes me look like i have a chest! plus for me!! it's also great for work and casual.,1
134,35,Recommend with one comment,"I usually wear a medium but in this top probably could have pulled off a small however i was afraid the neck would be too tight.  was considering the small because the arm holes were a bit baggier than i would like.  no issue with my bra showing though.  i wasn't able to try on the small to test my theory since i purchased online.  overall i love the color (blue), the fabric is comfortable, definitely loose but i'm okay with that on a hot sunny day.",0
134,35,Tight in the chest,"I'm 5'2 and based on some other reviews i opted for the regular rather than petite and am glad i did. even the regular is kind of short. if i raise my arm(s) all the way up, skin is typically exposed. i originally ordered a medium and i liked the fit everywhere except for the chest. i'm a 34dd and i felt like i couldn't move my arms. i exchanged it for a large to sacrifice some of the fit for some more arm movement. the cut is already a bit boxy so having it a bit boxier with more arm movement w",2

134,35,,"This top was just not flattering. i'm 5'8"" and medium build, and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn't fall in the right places. made me look very round and i'm not, so it's definitely going back!",9
134,36,Beautiful top - runs large,,0
134,36,Fun & different,"I love the colors in this top. the black tie makes this top different from anything else in my closet. the cut accentuates my shoulders, which i like. i usually wear a petite small, so i ordered this in an extra small and it fits nicely. the fabric could be a bit softer, but i still really like this top. it's unique and very feminine.",1
134,36,Fun trend splurge,"This top is my fun splurge for the summer. it's a little flowy but not over the top. and the quality is great. 

i'm 5""7, 120lb with really broad swimmer shoulders. i preferred the xs because it was a little bit less flowy on the sides than the s. but the length on the xs is dramatically shorter than s, so i went with the s.",0
134,36,Interesting,"Love the block appearance. looks exactly like on the model ! material again could have been better. dry clean only, so expensive wear. price per wear may be high due to that as each time you dry clean price actually goes up and use goes down.",1
134,37,Interesting piece,,0
134,37,Wanted to love it,"Ordered online, and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo doesn't show how incredibly wide the cut is. it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5'9, 130. the embroidery is lovely, but the style doesn't work. i had a small, but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height. might work better on someone with a more petite frame, but i do caution how ""voluminous"" the cut",3
134,38,Adorable but runs small,"I agree with others that this top runs small. i am usually a 2/4 in retailer tops and the small was very tight around the chest area. however, it looked so cute on! i wanted to buy it so badly, but it just didn't work for me. the design is absolutely adorable but i could not lift my arms without the whole top riding up. they did not have a medium in the store so i couldn't see if a larger size would work. overall, such a cute top, just not appropriate for someone my age or practical for someone ch",1
134,38,Beautiful blouse; not good for full figures,"I purchased this blouse in my usual size xl. the wine color is very nice, sort of a rusty cranberry. i so badly wanted to love this blouse but i have to return it. there is so much fabric in the back that it makes me look like a giant cranberry. it is not flattering at all on my full figure. maybe if i was very slender, the massive volume of fabric wouldn't matter but sadly it needs to go back. on a side note, this is a cotton blouse and i believe it is going to require ironing since i badly wri",11
134,38,Very pretty blouse; sleeves impractical,"I normally wear an xl, but could only find this instore in size large. the blouse fits nicely, but i think it would come down a bit lower and also be a longer blouse if i would have purchased it in my usual size. the blouse itself has a nice drape to it. the black 'railroad tracks' look very pretty in person, and add a nice detail. the only complaint i have with this blouse is the sleeves. the enormous bell sleeve feels like a costume. but for a nominal fee i had the sleeves shortened to a ruffl",0
134,38,What a stunning top!,"I am so glad that i ordered this top. it is kind of shimmering and looks so pretty in person! it is nicely lined and i love the sweetheart shape at the front. i am 5'2"", 34b, broad shoulder, ordered size s and m, and they both fit quite nicely. the size s is more like a trailered fit on me, while the size m gives more room for my arms and shoulder, also extra length that i can tuck it in my low-raise demin. i ended up keeping size m since i like my tops to fit a bit more flowy. i can see myself",2
134,39,A tad thin and see through,"I tried on xs petites as someone had returned it . i didn't find that it ran small, it was ok on me. i am not sure if the regular size would work but i didn't end up purchasing this today as the color was jsut so-so on my skin tone.

likes: contrast and detail in ruffle, romantic

dislikes: the tag pulled on the fabric a bit and you could tell, so the fabric seemed fragile.",1
134,39,Lovely in lace,"Absolutely stunning design with the eyelet lace top!  it's a very romantic, comfortable top that has a flattering fit. i'm so glad that it has lining so i don't need to be concerned about exposing myself to anyone.  it has a light fabric so it's very comfortable in the summer heat and humidity in florida.",1
134,39,Short mumu,"On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...

134,39,"Well made, long and flowing","This elegant-with-a-slight-edge top has a lovely neckline and is very comfortable. i chose the denim/blue version, which i wouldn't wear with jeans, but it's great with crops. i imagine it will be a good layering piece in the fall. it's long, but not long enough to be a dress. overall, it's flattering and slightly structured up top with tiny buttons at the back of the neck?generous and full below.",3
134,40,Better in person; size up,,1
134,40,Runs huge,This top runs 2 full sizes large. had to send back and didn?t want to bother with getting a new one.,2
134,40,So flattering,Make sure to get the whole outfit. the skirt sits high enough so that it avoids the muffin look.,2
134,41,,This top is so pretty. the fabric is absolutely gorgeous and the lace on the collar and back add an elegant old world vibe to this beautiful blouse. it is very light and flowy and i can imagine it will be nice and cool for those hot summer days to come. i am rather large chested so it does look a little tent like from the side but that is not the case fron the front and honestly i really don't care because it is so comfortable and pretty. i know i will wear this top quite a bit this summer.,2
134,43,"Adorable, crisp top","I love this blouse. it's a tad more billowy than i would have thought but looks fine. to wear to work i need to wear a camisole underneath as it's a bit sheer. and the button at the back of the neck broke immediately, but is still functional. the decorative part fell off. they give you a replacement button so if i decide it matters i'll sew that one on.

i absolutely love the blue stitching on this and how crisp it is. i didn't realize it was dry clean only but that doesn't bother me.",1
134,43,,I love the muted coloring! this top is generously sized. i have a small bust and it is roomy under the arms. i wish it was less full around the waist area.,1
134,45,Bettors off the shoulder top is a must!,"I fell in love with this top online and was even more pleased when it arrived. it's pure romance in a top. i went to the store and they didn't have it in yet, so i ordered it at the store. free shipping if ordered from store. i was extremely thrilled with everything about this purchase.",2
134,45,Love!,,1
134,45,One of the cutest tops i have for this summer!,,3
134,46,Fit is unflattering,"I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured, but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately, i am taking back.",0
134,47,Perfect peasant top,"This caught my eye in the store because of the beautiful bell sleeves so i had to try it on. i tried on an xs and small to see what fit better. for me, i am 5""3' and about 120 lbs, the xs fit better. i usually do take an xs in tops. i wore it out recently with a pair of distressed jeans and it looked great. as with most of the items you see online it is always better to see it in person as the pictures do not do it justice. the material was nice and flowy. i did not feel the neckline was too low",2
134,47,Retailer at its best!,"On any given day, i can usually find tons of stuff i like at retailer, but every once in a while comes an item that is extra special.

it has adorable details, lovely print, fits beautifully and can't be found anywhere else. oh, and the quality is good. 

this top is it for me!

i love the print, and the sleeves remind me a bit of a kimono except that this top's fabric is smooth and flowy.

134,49,Lovely if you don't have curves!,"The lace detail on this blouse is beautiful. i love that it is cotton and it has a detachable camisole which is a nice touch. unfortunately, this didn't work for me as i found it extremely unflattering. the gathered material just doesn't work if you have a large bust. it made me look enormous, which is never a good feeling. i recommend, but only for tall, slim types with a small bust.",4
134,49,"So cute, but tricky fit","This top is adorable and looked pretty on, but when i raised my arms the top wanted to rise up and then stay there above the breast level. it didn't settle back into place when i lowered my arms. maybe a larger size would have helped, but then it would have been a boxy fit. i also found it hard to take off, even with the button on the back of the neckline. the length is cropped, so you would want to wear it with a high-waisted skirt or pants. i like the details in the fabric a lot, but i didn't",2

134,51,Short wasted and fun,"Fyi the neck does have a hook and eye closure so there is room to get it on and off. the fabric is not stretchy. the lining is a nice navy. however, the sleeves are not lined. the cut outs have a beautiful blue lace behind it. it hit me at my waist. i'm 5' 3"" , 118#. i loved this top. worked with a pair of the new essential skinny trouser by retailer, and the nansen pointelle cardigan in yellow. this also paired well with a pair of rust colored skinny pilcro with a long necklace.",4
134,51,Very femenine and pretty!,"Well, i totally disagree with the previous reviewer on this one! i think this top is very pretty. yes, it does hide any flaws in the tummy, but it is not wide nor does it make you look pregnant (side or front view). i am 5 ft, 2 inches, broad shouldered, 36c and the small fit nicely (i usually wear a small to medium in retailer tops). i am thinking of purchasing the xs as there is still plenty of room around the chest/arm area. the lace is pretty, looks good worn with a dark colored pant. the only",9

134,53,Such a cute top!,"Just got this top in the mail today, and i love it. i bought the white in a small, and it fits as pictured on the model. the fabric says it's cotton, but it's a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk. the bodice is lined, so no bra lines show through. the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or see-through. the arm holes are not too large, as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops. i think i'll be wearing this one a lot this summer, and a lot of summers",0

134,58,So much cuter than picture!!,"I was checking out at my local retailer when one of the salespeople held up this top and said someone had just returned it.  they were talking about how cute it was (they didn't have it in the store).  i asked what size it was and it was a medium, so i said i want to try it on.  after trying it on, i fell in love, it is so cute, the cut fit great.  it is a little big but the small might have been too snug in the bust.  if you are in between sizes, you can probably size down.  i wore it yest",1
134,58,Very versatile,I love how feminine and interesting this top is. what i especially like is that you can layer different colored camis underneath to get a completely different look. the weight of the material makes it appropriate for all seasons. it is very well made and is something you can wear to work and also wear if you are going out afterward.,0
134,60,Disappointing,Loved how this top looked online and couldn't wait to get it. i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online. i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off. this is going back!,0
134,60,"Great details, on trend","I fell in love with this top online. i am obsessed with the little flounce detail on the sleeve and the slight a-line shape of the body. i was able to try it on in store and was glad i did because i ended up sizing up to a small from my usually x-small. i still put ""true to size"" because i think the forgiving cut allows the top to work in multiple sizes. i even tried on a medium and it still looked like it fit. the arms are a bit tight, as the other reviewer mentioned so keep in mind when choosi",1
134,60,Off the shoulder elastic issues,"The problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized , therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly . the only elastic should be right at the shoulders , the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem. .",13

134,66,Strange fit,"For a couple weeks, i debated making this purchase. in fear that my size would no longer be available, i ordered this lovely top. when it arrived, i was immediately disappointed with its colors...unlike the vibrant colors in the photo, the top's colors were dull...more a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender. had the fit been better, i would have kept this item despite of its color. it's cut weird! though it runs slightly large, i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and",6
134,66,Unique,"This sweatshirt is beautiful and a step beyond the ordinary. the white is crisp and the lace is just beautiful. the black striping is subtle and really attractive. i had a problem with the fit. it just grabbed my mid section in an unattractive way. i wear large in more fitted items and that's what i ordered this time. i'm well endowed and it fit nicely over my bust, shoulders and arms so afraid the next size up will be too big. although it didn't work for me i highly recommend this beautiful top",0

135,29,Super cute pants,These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute. they seem to run just a bit small (i sized up one size from my usual) and don't seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary. the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile.,1

135,38,Makes me look dumpy,"I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice, they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead, which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall, but at 5' 6"" these are a miss for me!",15
135,38,My new favorite pant,"These pants are amazing! i love that they zip in the back and the material is just right. i am 5'7"" and they are the perfect length. i bought the black and now buying the gray. i hope they come out with more colors!!!",0
135,39,Tts but long,"I ordered the 0p, in red and love these pants. the only problem is even in petites, these are long on me (maybe ok with 4 inch heels). the cut is comfortable and flattering, i have muscular thighs and these fall nicely on me. the color is also nice for this fall. i purchased last year's version (grey and turquoise, but reverse from what is offered this year) and they are very comparable (although i bought them too big last year). fabric not prone to easy wrinkling, highly recommend.

135,39,,"Love these pants!!! retailer - please sell more colors and patterns of these! i have a hard time finding work pants that fit right, don't have to be hemmed (i'm 5'3"") and aren't boring. this is just enough pattern to be interesting, but still neutral enough to pair with other things. i bought them full price and would happily do so again for another pattern!",0
135,40,Everyone needs a little blue pants,"I love everything about these pants- the color, the fit, the detail. oh, and these have a button fly. i didn't realize that when i ordered them, but i love it. i haven't had a pair of button fly pants in so long. these have a nice stretch to them as well. hei hei knows what they're doing. and i got them on sale. thank you retailer!!",0

135,42,Not what i expected,I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them.,0
135,43,Better than in the photo,"Don't pay attention to the less-than-flattering photo. these jeans are super cute and very flattering. they are actually long, not ankle length as the photo implies. high waisted with a 70s bell bottom vibe. nice light denim for year round wear. they fit like a dream.",0
135,44,Very disappointed,"I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors. like another reviewer, within a few weeks, having worn them no more than a couple of times, the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes. i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them. so disappointing, as i really did love the pants. total waste of money.",1

the subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg. overall a really flattering cut. the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top.",8
135,48,Recommend but not for me,"Love pilcro, love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you, however!",0
135,48,,"I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button, which is interesting 'cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly, as usual. but it ended up being ok because i don't care for the speckled, slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go!",2

135,50,Super cute wear well,I ordered the neutral in a 2p. i had to hem them. i 5' about 110lbs. i wore them to wore. they wore beautifully with some wrinkling to be expected with linen. but they didn't look like i slept in them. i ordered another pair same size right after the first pair came and tried them on to find the fit tighter than the first pair. a bit disappointed. debating if they'll stay or get returned. i see the notes about stretching. overall a nice pant for the money.,2
135,52,Love these pants!,"These are the most comfortable, happening pants i have ever owned! they are extremely flattering and slimming at the waist. i am a size 4 and bought the 4, and they fit perfectly. they are a bit long, but after washing and drying on low, mine shrunk enough that i can wear them with flats or flip flops, and not just heels. my 2 teenage daughters have complimented me on them saying how ""modern"" they look. i bought them in navy and just ordered the grey yesterday. i might go into my local store and",1

135,54,Perfect!,"These pants are really great! the fabric is soft, but substantial, and the fit is so comfortable. i bought the ""grey"" color - it's a very light grey, almost a stone color. it's a perfect neutral to wear with just about any top you may have. i love the deep front pockets and the elastic waist is an added bonus. i'm 5'5"", 124 lb. and purchased the small.",1
135,55,Great summer pants,"These are nice, comfortable summer pants that travel well. the material has a nice feel to it,lightweight, but not too thin. they are easy to wear with any summer top, and look just dressy enough. i like the elastic waist, but the pants will stretch out a bit, and run a little large.",3

135,57,Best pants ever,,0
135,57,Great crop pant,"So i love pilcro, i wear them all the time and usually size down because they ""grow"" after wearing them. i tried on my usual size in these and felt like they are too tight, not sure if they will get any looser. the material feels really good, lightweight and the stripes are subtle but cute. not sure if i'll keep them or maybe size up,",3
135,57,Great quality but...,"I was so excited to receive these jeans. typically, wide leg jeans are a no brainer for me--super flattering and in chambray, i thought, they would be stylish and comfortable. but i found these to be verging on mom jean. something about them seems not so cool. maybe the color of the wash, the weight of the fabric? not sure, but they don't lend themselves to current looks. sadly, i will be sending them back.",1

135,60,Funky fit,I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good.,0
135,67,Wonderful pants,"Just wanted to add my comments to the review that stated these pants ran small in the waist.  i sized up because of that review and ordered an extra large as i wanted these to be loose and comfortable. i typically am a m/l in retailer.  the xl is actually a little big but not enough that i need to return them. if you order these in a fit that is fairly loose, these are not see through at all. (i ordered the color shown on the model) i am about 5 feet 4 so the pants are not as cropped on me .",0
135,70,Great pants for the summer,"I've been looking for comfortable pants for the summer.  this pants is the answer.  it's comfortable, thin, and yet not to sheer.  this pants a bit loose, i could fit in s.  i usually buy size 8 or 10 for shorts from retailer, so i'll say this pants run big.  the con with this pants is the stitching around the back pockets is not very sturdy.  i found tiny holes on 2 other pairs before i bought mine.",1

136,20,,The only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big. i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for. i wouldn't say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect. still love it!,0
136,20,,"The shirt is darling, soft and relaxed fit. i usually wear an xs or small in most retailer tops. unfortunately, i ordered an xs and should have ordered the small. i found the length to be a little short in the xs so i'm sending it back to exchange for the small. i hope it's just a little bit longer.",1

136,28,Love the stripes,"I tried both the xs and s in the store. i am usually an xs, but ended up buying the s, because the xs was really short and i didn't want it to be any shorter after washing. the s fit more like a normal t-shirt, although the back is longer. love the color (blue) and the fabric is super soft. also happy that it's not too thin, nor see-through.",0

136,31,Great material,"Love the lilac purple color, breathable yet not see through material is soft on your skin. i like the small detail cut out in the back, and a high bonus point for not showing your bra. one minor thing i would change is the length of the string in the back, but not a big deal.",0

136,49,A lovely piece to be worn and cherished,"This is great. on the model it looks largish, but on me it doesn't. if you're curvier like me (5'10"", 155, 32e) it may be more fitted. long arms with great wrists. design is just as shown. not a sturdy piece. but not cheap looking in any way. i plan to hand-wash and not drop coffee down the front so i can wear it for a long time. just what i want to wear on certain days, and more colors would be great. thanks, retailer.",13
136,49,Cute top,"I bought this top in 2 colors -- white and light green. i really like them both. the shirt is a nice weight and texture and the soft green color is really nice. the fit is true to size. i am 5'-6"" and 145 lbs. and the medium was perfect. i like how the back dips in a slight v as well.",2

136,49,Nice summer weight t,"Pros: versatile summer weight t. perfect with jeans. flattering cut. nice color palette. made in the usa. reasons for not giving 5's for overall rating and quality... shirt is a bit short overall (i'm 5'4). fabric is thin and a mixed blend of poly, cotton, and rayon. will have to be careful with washing. better if you can purchase on sale. regular price was steep for a t-shirt.",0
136,51,Much bigger than last year's version,"I ordered these tees in the navy and pink thinking that it would be a slam dunk given i already bought 3 of the same tees last year. not so. this year's version is much bigger - almost 2 inches wider and about 2 inches longer. there was even a 2 inch difference between the pink and navy version so i have to assume that sizing may vary among different colors. too bad for me - but i did read a review that thought the tees were better this year. i guess we are all different. at 5'7"", 115lbs i prefe",0

136,53,"More colors, please!","Love this top - it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch. it is light weight and not too long or wide. i have other t.la tops in small, but the xsm worked better for me with this top.",1
136,53,"Nice tee, but i was not aware how cropped it is","The tee looks longer on the model. i am 5 feet 9 and this tee is showing of my belly which surprise me a bit. i thought it would hit the waist line. still, very nice tee, i love cotton, it simply is the best. colors are nice too.",0

136,53,Summer time comfort,"I bought the red motif for my summer wardrobe; i'll be on the road for most of the month of august and wanted to create a super comfortable capsule wardrobe that would launder without ironing. this top is well made, super soft, and works well with jeans, capris, skirts, and leggings due to its longer length over my posterior. i should have read the other reviews first though, this is a tad large and i needed to us invisible tape to keep everything from hanging out the front. i ordered a medium a",0

136,54,,"Great tee! the color online is lighter and nicer in my opinion than in reality. it's much darker in real life, but otherwise it's a super soft tee with gently fluttered sleeves and side slits. i bought it in a s and it's roomy without being oversized. great for fall....",4
136,54,,"I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo",0

136,64,Fabric is pretty thin,"I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute, but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call, but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed, so that remains to be seen.",0
136,64,Pretty blue,"That was the only color i liked. it's great if you have a tummy like me and is long enough in the back to cover your butt. back detail is cute, but annoying. sometimes it shifts around and my bra shows, and the string is at least 3 feet too long. 
not bad, i wear it with white gauze pants, looks nice. good with leggings too.",0
136,65,Fine t shirt,I ordered this online. it's fine. i am usually a small in tops and it fits true to the size. good material. no complaints. looks good layered.,0
136,65,Very soft fabric but size down,I seldom take anything but a size m in retailer tops. this m top fits ok but it is a bit sloppy overall. one reviewer says it is 'body skimming' but not on me. i am a true m yet a m seems to fit in the shoulders but overall just too big. i love the fabric and print however i will exchange for a size s if it is available. it does hide the tummy area but ends up looking like a pajama top on me.,1

136,66,Sporty and chic,"This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast. i purchased the ""red"" and hoped that it was more of a rust color-lucked in! the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layering-which is alway a plus. i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of them,in fact the stripes do the work and disguise! and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker! you won't be disappointed",1
136,66,Tee,"I ordered the white tee in xs and am returning it. it runs tts & had a good fit but i didn't like the material at all. maybe because it was white, but it was see through & like a tissue tee that i would expect to get little holes in it near the waist. the sleeves are gathered in the center of the sleeve & i didn't like the way that looked.",4

137,69,"New ""hot pants"" for winter leggings",I needed a legging to wear with boots. makes sense that if it is cold enough to wear boots in socal then it is too cold to wear thin leggings. try to find warm leggings....almost impossible until retailer put fleece lined leggings in their catalogue! the leggings have a vertical knitted stripe which elongates the leg and they are warm! perfection in garments is very rare but these leggings are hot.,0

138,32,,"This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper, you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.",0
138,33,Poofy,"I wish these fit more like joggers, but they are slightly poofier. with the big buttons, i felt a bit too clownish. however, it's a great statement piece if you're up for it. the quality is good and the fabric has a nice texture. i think the problem was that since linen doesn't drape and scrunch like less structured fabrics, so it holds more volume instead of loose, semi-flowy menswear look. i",1
138,34,Recommended for certain body types,"Other reviews are correct. but this has potential to look as good as on the model - structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering. makes legs look miles long. however this fits very tight, allows no room for extra tummy, hips, booty, or thighs. i ordered a s (i'm usually a 4) - was able to get it on (step into it from the top), but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was. if there was an m, would have definitely sized up, as i really liked the look.",2

138,40,Stretch out a lot,"Purchased these recently and loved the fit and feel upon trying them on. i was hoping that unlike linen pants, they'd keep their shape. no such luck. after an hour or two in them they were hanging and sagging. this is after being a (good) snug fit. i purchased my usual size and i'd say they stretched at least a size or two bigger. the color and feel of these is very nice and i see them being perfect for a very casual or slightly dressier outfit so i do recommend them. however, buy them small bec",0
138,41,Cool fabric,"But i didn't like the fit. maybe because i ordered petite and the length threw me off, but they weren't flattering in any way. the color and material were unique and pleasing. had to send them back though.",0

138,45,Great product,"Fits well (true to size), very stylish and comfortable. i'm going to have to buy these in more colors!",0
138,46,Flimsy,"I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable, however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed, so if you want a clean look, you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.",1

138,56,Very comfortable and flattering,"These pants are extremely comfortable and flattering. i bought them in coral, and wore with a black peasant top, sandals and a long necklace. they do stretch out a lot though, so i would recommend sizing down. i bought mine to look like they fit on the model, and after a few hours they were hanging off of me, so buy them a little bit tighter than you like. the drawstring is purely decorative and does not tighten the waist.",21
138,74,Great look,Love these pants. also ordered them in blue. great fit and style.,0
139,31,Itchy express,I was so excited to receive this sweater in the mail since my local store didn't carry it. it is a very cute design if you have a smaller frame but i'm curly up top and it didn't lay they way it did on the model. there's plenty of stretch. unfortunately the fabric sheds and itches terribly. you could wear a shirt underneath but i'd have to wear a turtleneck so it'll be going back.,35
139,33,Comfy with great design,As someone that has many cardigans this one is one of my favs in my collection. i can dress it up or down. it is really soft and great quality. i only wish i had checked if it came in petite since the length is a little long.,0

140,27,Cute and comfy,"I tried this on in-store and would have purchased if it have been a better price, it wasn't something i could justify spending $100 bucks on. it's cute and was surprisingly comfortable but again, not worth the asking price. i will buy when it goes on sale.",6

140,32,A little long,"I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so, it's too big but the length works), or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable, and the design is different in a good way.",0
140,32,"Didn't work for me, but it is beautiful","This skirt didn't fit me right--i'm 5'6"" and the hem hit too low, making for a frumpy rather than classic look. the fabric and color are lovely, however, and on a taller person this could be beautiful. the draping is beautiful and slimming.",1

140,33,Different in person,"The first surprise is that in person, the material is actually kind of woolen? at least, i would definitely call it a winter knit. the colors are also a little different -- so much so that i didn't recognize it in the store. i'm not sure if the one i tried on was stretched out, but it definitely ran large on me. the waistband is elastic, so i would worry about is stretching over time. i would have been curious to see what the petite option looked like on me, as the regular version was longer tha",1
140,33,Great skirt but..,"Ok, so maybe i am too picky because the pattern is lovely, the colors are great, the fabric is quality, the fit is flattering, the sizing is appropriate. that said, the high to low hemline shows the inner fabric so it kinda stands out when you are moving and i find it distracting so unfortunately i am returning it. sizing reference, i wear a size 8/10 in pants, i'm 5'3 and the medium petite fit comfortably.",4

140,33,Very clingy,"This skirt is much more vivid in person, which i like. the fit though was off for me. i ordered my usual size medium. i wear a 6 or 8 in bottoms. the medium was fitted!! you could see every curve. definitely not comfortable with that! i would probably have a better fit with a size up, however, i am not a fan of the gray lining that you can see on the inner back portion of skirt... so i think i will pass on this one.",0
140,34,"Misnomer in color, stunning on any figure","I'm not sure why they call this ""black"" because what you see in this pictures depicted is pretty much the shade in person. the fabric itself is lovely. it made my wider hips look smaller! :)

141,44,Modern hippie happy beauty,"This is a modernized hippie sweater, so beautiful. blue is more for fall but i think the mustard color has more personality. the large flowers add attitude, pockets show comfort. it is soft (part silk fabric) and lays nicely. it is not thick enough for warmth, but there is room for a tissue turtleneck. regular s fits me well (it should be relaxed look, not fitted) and i wear it as a dress with thick tights and boots (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and the hem falls right above my knees).",0
141,45,Can't wait to wear this,"I tried this on and think it will look great with leggings and boots. it's very flattering without being too tight or too baggy. some of retailer's clothes are just too full and baggy for me and make me look large. i am 5'4"" 140 lbs and ordered the medium which fits perfectly. i ordered both the navy and yellow, but the yellow has not arrive yet.",1
141,45,Love it,"This is my favorite find of the fall. i got the mustard color and it is wonderful.   very soft, nice shape, unique design. i am usually between a medium and large in tops, but i found that the medium was a little too short for my liking.  (i am  5 ft 8 in tall).  even sizing up, it's far too short for me to wear as a dress as some others had mentioned, but looks great with jeans and boots. the large is perfect!!",0
141,46,Disappointment in the ivory version,"I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab, poorly-made, too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock, then i would have overlooked the problems. but, there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.",0
141,47,Love my poppy tunic,I do not have an retailer where i live so i ordered this tunic online. the material is extremely soft & comfortable ( not at all itchy). tts. i fell in love with it immediately and can't believe how many compliments i received all day long when i wore it to work ( with some skinny ankle length pants). can be dressed up or down. this is certainly going to get a lot of use this fall,0
141,49,Beautiful color and fit,I purchased the poppy pocket tunic in yellow. the color is perfect and looks great with my dark grey leggings. cannot wait until it's cold enough to wear.,0
141,49,Too short,"I'm about 5'9"" and this sweater was too short for me. the arm length was great but the overall length was just too short :-( i'll be returning this one.",6

141,50,,"This is a beautiful sweater that i wanted to love but i couldn't for a few reasons i thought i'd share: the color is bright orange. it is not softer like peach in the picture. it also was more clingy than a curvy woman like me can wear. i thought'd be more swingy but it was more structured. very pretty and good quality,tho.",7
141,51,Poppy pocket tunic revie,"I liked everything about this tunic except the way that it looked on me. the fabric was great - not too heavy, not too light. the design was cute and i loved the colors (i got the yellow). it was cut well, and a good length for me (i am 5'2""). that being said, i am curvy and i felt like i looked even rounder in this top. if i was 6-8"" taller it probably would have been perfect.",0
141,51,Worth the sale price,Tts. i'm wearing a small. the black goes with so many of my charlie print pants. washed nicely. layers flat to dry. had to iron the shell underneath. great for casual office.,2
141,52,,"I absolutely love this sweater, very comfortable and flattering!!! i'm thinking of buying it in another color!!!",0
141,53,,"I am so happy with this! i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving it as i expected it to be of lesser quality than what i found it to be. it is a medium weight weave, grey sweater with a beautiful design and texture; one of those pieces that you will tire of long before it wears out! it is a great layering piece but not over bulky or structured tops as it is very smooth fitting without a whole lot of give. that is to say it is not loosely woven so it is better over a snug fitting item. the colo",2
141,53,,"This is a soft, light sweater that will take you through fall. i got the raspberry, which seems more like a cinnamon color to me. the design is really cute with the fabric inset in the back. i got three of these in different colors so obviously i really like them for layering and can recommend them! it seems tts. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs. medium is perfect.",1
141,54,Adorable!!!,,0
141,54,All wrong,I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.,1
141,54,The perfect cardigan,"I love love love this cardigan!! i ordered it in plum, regular small as they were out of petite small ( my preferred size). i was very impressed with the quality of the cardigan. the details like the sheer fabric around the neckline are very delicate and beautiful. the waist line sits exactly where it should. i was worried it would sit too low as i am short and did not get this in petite sizing. so maybe i should say this cardigan runs small. i think i have found the perfect cardigan. it goes wi",1
141,56,Adorable dress,,12
141,57,Beautiful and cozy,"This is a beautiful sweater/tunic/dress. i ordered in the mustard color, and wearing it will brighten my day on a dreary winter morning. it is so hard to find winter clothes in bright colors. the sweater is soft and not itchy. it is a bit longer than i expected...maybe 35"" (i am 5'7""), but that is just fine! it can be worn with leggings or tights. dressed up or dressed down. i couldn't be more pleased.",1
141,59,Amazing.,"This cut and fit is so good. i sized up because my body just needs that with pullovers generally, and i was glad i did. it fits just right!",0
141,62,"Nice sweater, on sale too!",Can't say about fit just yet since it is a gift; color is soft green and versatile. finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt,0
141,64,Great,What a nice sweater! i just received this in the gray and i think it is one of the most flattering sweaters i've gotten in a long time. the fit is true to size. the sleeves are very long and tight halfway to the elbows and fit well in the upper arms. the stitching on the body gives an illusion of height and is slenderizing. the weight is perfect for every season. i am very happy with everything about this sweater.,0
141,64,Lightweight cardigan,"This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad, but unexpected. i am very short -waisted, and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished, and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.",0
141,64,Very nice!,"This sweater is light gray, as shown in the photo, not dark gray as the description states. i went up from my usual size so would say it runs small. it is lightweight enough that i think i will get adequate use out of it this winter in fl.",3
141,67,Perfect little sweater,"This sweater is just the cutest- sweet and feminine with interesting details especially in the back. it's very figure flattering worn closed (there are 3 adorable little buttons) or it can be worn open over a dress or a cami.
it runs very small, i usually wear a small or extra small but i bought this one in a medium, mindful of the reviews. i'm so glad i did since in addition to running small the sweater did shrink a little when i washed it even though i hand washed it in cold water. it wasn't a",1

141,69,Beautiful,"I really like this top. bought it in ""purple"" but i would not call it that. it is more maroon or burgundy. color is exactly what it shows in the online photo. really like the green also. crocheted arms are super. i found it ran slightly small, so if you are between sizes, order up. one slight personal problem for me is that there is cashmere in it and i live in florida. even though we do get cooler weather here, i am not sure i will have that much chance to wear it; it will be too warm for me. t",1
141,74,Adorable!,I ordered this in xsp navy with the merlot/burgundy flower and it fits above the knees as pictured. the tunic is medium weigh and has a-line shape with a loose waist and i find it very comfortable. the sleeve are straight cut (not tight) and 3/4 quarter in length. i will wear it with leggings and boots/booties this coming fall.. i find this tunic is well-made and disagreed with one review that it is cheaply made.

141,83,,"I purchased this sweater in the grey and loved it.
much prettier in person, the photos do not show the delicate details, which are lovely.
i found that it fits true to size and has a very flattering fit.
it is also a very versatile piece depending on what you pair it with.
i love it so much that i purchased the peach and wine colors as well.
i found all 3 colors beautiful and each gives this sweater a different look.
the grey is sophisticated and works well with almost anything.
the peach is del",1
142,32,Goes with everything,"This is a beautifully made jacket. i ended up buying the cream color as the yellow had sold out. the cream goes with everything, so that was probably the right decision. the inside of the jacket has a silk lining with a scotty dog pattern. the jacket fabric has just the right weight to hang properly, without being too heavy.",0
142,33,Boxy and gapes but thick and well made,I love the look and design of this piece but the fit is awkward. the m gapes open and is much boxier than it looks on the model but the s is too tight in the elbows. i think i might have to return it :(,0
142,34,"Looks good, casual",Very interesting material.  the very subtle/light window pane pattern is perfect.,0
142,34,Not as small as other reviewers have said,I was so afraid to get a too-small blazer (based on other reviews) that i ordered this two sizes up. i am usually a 0 or 2 in a blazer and ordered a 4. it was huge. i then ordered a 2 and it is just right. it's comfortable and chic and i love the blue and black combination.,1
142,35,"Fabric feels cheap, not great construction","This design looks really sharp on the image, but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft, with a gray jersey lining, it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.  

i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b, i felt like i was busting out of a size 8, and i am a 34d.",1
142,36,Beautiful but too small...,"This jacket is absolutely beautiful. the color is a much deeper navy than it appears in the pictures, and the brocade with the contrasting lining is lovely. however, as another reviewer commented, the back across the shoulders is incredibly small. i ordered up from my normal 2 to a 4, and it was still too tight. there is no way i could even lift my arms over my head without ripping out the back of the jacket. i fear a 6 will be too big. this one is going back, sadly.",1
142,38,,This jacket is a great buy at the sale price. drape is wonderful and the weight is nice; lightweight and will transition well from summer to fall. the adjustable ties at the waist make it very flattering on a curvy figure. i purchased the white and am going to purchase the black as well. definitely recommend.,0
142,40,,"Just beautiful! the details and the colors are combined in such an usual and chic way. the fit is really comfortable too--i found that the jacket runs tts, maybe even a bit large, but i purchased my regular size so that i could wear layers. keep in mind, i have a rather large bust, so someone with a smaller one could probably size down. please note, there are no closures in the front of the jacket, but it looks almost closed when you're wearing it.",14
142,42,Had great possibilities,"Loved this as soon as i saw it. definitely darker than the photo; not as muted. since it was a jacket and i'd be wearing something under it, i chose a medium rather than the small i generally wear. the shoulders just fit and the rest was big making me look large. not a flattering fit and a major disappointment. nice that it works for the other reviewers but not for me. sadly, going back. the sweater shown underneath also runs loose and large so i'm exchanging that one for a small.",9
142,44,,,5
142,48,Fabric is poor quality,I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.,4
142,48,Stylish jacket but runs small,"The only thing i did not like about this jacket was that i could not find it in my size before it sold out! retailer, please bring back another iteration for spring!",0
142,49,I looked like a linebacker,"When i saw this jacket in store, i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3"" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc",0
142,53,Wait for a sale,"At first i was interested. i liked the color, the soft tencel fabric, the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back. 
all in all, it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.
it does run tts.",3
142,56,Awesome jacket,First saw the jacket online and liked it so i went to the store to check out. the color looks nicer in person.  it fitted me really well and looked really nice on me. the jacket is very soft and well made.  the only thing is the sleeves are a little longer but not a big deal. can't wait to wear it when the full is here!,0
142,57,Quilted jacket,"The jacket is cute, it runs small but looks good. i like it even though it feels tight on my arms.",2
142,58,Great addition to fall/winter wardrobe,"I saw this piece and fell in love with it. the print is beautiful and is well placed on every piece! it is a little boxy, and is a bit warm for indoors, but it is unusual enough to overlook the flaws. i am 5'10"". usually a small, but sized up to a medium with this one.",0
142,60,Stunning,This blazer is gorgeous. the brocade fabric is beautiful. the color is really a blueish purple/indigo. you can wear it with a black skirt/pants and even jeans. the only downside is that it runs about one size smaller than what it says it is.,1
142,61,Love blazer but sizing way off,,2
142,62,White is not white,"This is a very nice jacket in a pretty textured fabric. it seems to fit tts, and the cut is very flattering. however - the ""white"" is actually ivory. not a big deal, unless you were trying to match an outfit with pure white in it. still on the fence about whether to keep it or not.",13
142,67,Edgy jacket will add oomph to outfits,"This jacket is well made and the fit is perfect. it is quilted and will work well three seasons of the year. it goes with jeans, cords and flannel, and would work with skirts and dresses. colors are a bit more muted and darker than my display shows, but only slightly. studs and black trim really punch up the look of this jacket. i am very pleased with it!",11
142,68,Just didn't do it for me,"I bought this (because it looks beautiful, is well made, and a high quality piece). when i got it home and tried it on, it did not achieve the look i was going for (boho). instead, it was very drapery and full and big and i felt like i was wearing a ghost costume on halloween. i do love retailer's kimonos and thought i'd love this one. but it's going back. i don't need any more clothes in my closet that i do not absolutely love and want to wear again and again. that is my new criteria for purchasi",5
142,69,Great jacket!!!,"Cannot believe this is still available and on sale. am 5' 6 1/2"", 150lbs, size 12 is perfect. this jacket goes with everything i try it with. it is silky smooth but still has structure. is a softer blue than navy. i love it! this is an absolute steal on sale.",1
143,34,,I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.,0
143,35,My new favorite cardigan,"This is the softest cardigan i own. perfect for lounging, going to / from yoga or dressing it up with a statement piece or a scarf. i've worn it buttoned or open, and receive many compliments. i have it hanging on the inside of my closet door because i wear it more than anything else at the moment : )",1
143,36,,Love this cardigan! i've been searching for a comfortable lounge type of sweater and this is perfect. the sleeves are a bit tighter than the body. but i would wear it over a tank top so it is comfortable. i am 125 lb and 5'5' and i ordered my usual m.,0
143,37,Wanted to love this!,"This is a beautiful cardigan. its effortless, lightweight, with some cool detail to keep that low key look extra stylish. the moss color is very subtle with a small lined print. i wanted to love this...the detail, the length, the weight and the color are all so dreamy...but for me, the arms were super tight. normally i'm a l or xl in all retailer tops and sweaters...and i do have larger arms which is always a struggle for me when shopping. i couldn't even get the cardigan on my arms. there is no s",8

144,26,My favorite black top.,"This is a timeless top. i loved the overall look of the top and after eyeing it for several days decided to purchase it. warning, the shoulder area is cut small due to the fabric at the top. i am usually a size 12 (because of ddd chest) but i bumped up to a 14 and it was perfect.",1
144,28,Lovelove!,"Retailer has done it again! i love this top. i purchased it for our engagement photos. i am typically a small or medium, and decided to size down for this one. i purchased a small and it fit perfectly! its not near as long as it is in the photo, which pleased me. i did read about busty ladies having a problem with the fit - and i can definitely see how that would be an issue.",0
144,31,Amazing tank!,I absolutely love this tank. it goes great with a pair of jeans and cute booties. great colors and material. i love the nigh neck.,0
144,32,Great top - beautiful details,Highly recommend this top. received lots of compliments on the day that i wore. recommend wearing with a tank top.,1
144,32,"Pretty, but unlined!","I really love the look and feel of this top, perhaps this was mentioned in previous reviews, but it is unlined, which i hadn't realized when i ordered it. so the eyelet details are will expose skin unless you wear a cami underneath.",0
144,32,,"Like the other reviewers have said, this is a wider shirt, but the width done is in a stylish way. i did not think it looked frumpy or sack-like on. however, i found it to be rather short. i bought a 0 regular (not petite), and it fits shorter than many shirts i have from retailer, madewell, etc. which have the same looser fit. i am 5'2, 115 lbs., so it is odd that it fit somewhat short on me...if you are tall, it might bare your midriff some. i bought the peach, which was close to the color pictu",1
144,33,Fits like a tent,So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.,0
144,34,Beautiful top!,"I have to disagree with earlier reviewers who suggested this top isn't flattering for larger-breasted women. i'm breastfeeding, so i currently have dds that are the bane of my existence, and i was very happy with the way this top fit across my chest. i didn't give it a full 5 stars for aesthetic/design only because i wish it were a bit longer. it hit me below my waist, but not below the crotch of my jeans where it hits the model (possibly because she is not burdened by swollen breasts). the shir",4
144,34,Itchy,"Very pretty top, but like the other reviewers said?the neck is very itchy. i live in florida and i don't think i can wear this during the summer unless i get the neck lined. i got an xxs p which was a little shorter than i would have liked, so i am returning for xxs.",0
144,34,Massive!,"I get that it's a swing tank, and it's supposed to be loose but i got a 00p and it's huge! too much material. with that being said, it's such a cute top that i decided to keep it. i got it taken in about 2 inches on each side and it now looks great.",1
144,35,Beautiful top!,"For sizing, i normally wear either xs or s in tops (i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, 34a). i tried on both, and both fit, but the arm holes were a little too tight on the xs. i ended up picking the s because it felt most comfortable. when i tried on the ivory color, i could see my blue bra underneath, and it would require a cami. the black didn't. i love the embroidered design and ruffled neck. i agree the buttons on the back of the neck are a tad difficult to button, but it's not a deterrent.",0
144,36,,"After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it, i loved the fabric and color, however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!",1

144,37,I love this shirt,Perfect fit. though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami. i absolutely recommend this shirt. it fits tts.,0
144,39,Beautiful tank to wear for years,"I was urged to try this on by my usual stylist as she thought it would look nice with shorts i purchased or jeans or pencil skirt i own (she knows a lot of what i own). it is truly pretty love the embroidered cut outs makes the tank look stylish. the cut is also flattering, though i think i'll have to wear a strapless bra. color is also warm enough to work on pale skin like me or a golden tan. i purchased the 0 regulr, tried on petite but i found it was short and flared too much. i am 115 lbs 30",11
144,39,I like it enough,"But runs large. i tried on the regular 0 in the store and it was very pretty but baggy. would definitely need a tank if i were to wear this to work. lace is romantic and i do like the button details. i would give it a try but for me i will take my chance and wait for sale if it makes it there in my sie. i need 00. petite already gone sadly.

144,39,"Love the color, but not the fit","I wish this fit more to the body, it really does flare out a lot,a adding volume to the person wearing it. the mustard color is beautiful, so is the pink (i ordered both to compare). but the 00 was still big on me (and p). so i passed.
fabric is light for summer, so if you are thin, not muscular, perhaps that would look great?",1
144,39,Nice,"I ordered both colors in different sizes (xs and xxs) - petite were no longer available, so can't compare there.

color: i liked the black better for these reasons:
1) color can be worn year-round, just add a nice jacket or cardigan, and ok for winter season.
2) ivory was kind of see-through

size: xxs fit me better, the xs was wider and bigger arm holes.

144,39,So pretty!,"I wanted to get a couple tops for date nights that went well with skinny jeans and this hit the mark! as mentioned before, this top is translucent and thus would recommend using a cami as well. however the embroidery is beautiful. i have not had it cleaned yet and thus cannot comment on the durability. can't wait to wear it out.",2

144,40,Dissapointed,"This is a beautiful top, however it looks better on the 80 pound model. the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body. if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are.",2

144,43,Pretty top,"I fell in love with this top when i tried it on at the store. it's a great fall piece. it is see-through around the bust, so a nude bra or any color camisole would have to be worn. my only thing is that it seems a little dressy, so i'm wondering how much i'll wear it. i work from home so everything has to be somewhat casual. so, i do recommend it, but i'm undecided as to if i'm going to keep it. for reference, i'm a 34d with a thin upper body and took a size medium.",0
144,43,Size down!,"Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me, thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.",0
144,43,Soft and pretty,"Love this top, it looks just as pictured. the lilac color is just as it looks, which i am happy about. sometimes this shade ends up darker than it appears online, but not with this top. it is soft velvet, silky lining and hits right where it does on model. i got a pxs my usual size. i am 5'3. the neck is a bit tight once buttons are buttoned up, but again this is pictured. well made and very pretty. can dress up or down.",0
144,43,Unique and eye-catching top,I love floreat and was excited to find this top on sale. i received multiple compliments the first day i wore it. it is true that it might be better with a bit less fabric but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. the flowy shape it ideal for summer.,0
144,44,Work of art,"This is an extraordinary blouse and it is the poster child of retailer. the embroidery looks beautiful online but i appreciate it much more in person. the details are breathtaking, especially the scalloped borders around the arm holes, neck, and hem lines. i grew up around embroidery art and this is very high quality work, not even one stitch out of place and no hanging loose threads either. i like the black thread on cream because it's classy and it displays the details. the blouse materia",16
144,44,,"This top is absolutely adorable, i cannot express how much i love it. paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring, this can easily transition into summer. it's actually cuter irl than in the picture. if you are on the fence about this, get it! you won't regret it.",4
144,45,Beautiful blouse but....,"Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows.

oh well, it's going back!",0
144,45,"Gorgeous top, with the right bra (or lack thereof)","This top is so pretty, even better in person. it's made really well and i love that it's washable. i did have some initial reservations with the fit. i'm petite and small chested so i typically like to wear a bra to get a bit of extra 'help'. but with the way this top is cut, swingy and slightly bell shaped, i found that wearing a bra, even one with light foam cups (not even pushup), was making the shape of the top look really weird. once i took off the bra, the top actually looked great. i got",0
144,46,"Looks good in person, shrunk a lot","I bought this in size xl and it initially fit me similarly to the model. but, once i washed it (in cold in my machine, reshaped and air-dried), it was so much smaller/shorter. i loved the embroidery on the top. the mix of pattern colors is great too. i like when blues and blacks are mixed together. i don't know how i could have prevented the shrinking. i now throw on a shrug or jacket over to hide the shorter length. still stylish and fun.",0
144,46,Pretty but sheer,"If you care that it's sheer- be forewarned. i probably won't wear a cami under it, as it's not terrible, but worth noting. that said, its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best. it's cut quite generously and i do wish i'd gone down a size.",2
144,46,Stiff fabric,"I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store!",0
144,47,Beautiful embroidery,"My 16 year-old daughter fell in love with this when we saw it in the store at the beginning of the summer, but it was much, much too expensive. when i saw it on sale at the end of the summer, i jumped on it. she loves it.",0
144,47,"Beautiful, huge armholes","The design is stunning, the color is universally super-flattering. it's a lovely top. so much so that i tried it on even though it was pricey. but the armholes are huge. you can see it on the model, who is definitely not wearing a bra. on me, there was a lot of side bra exposure. if they'd had smaller sizes at the berkeley store, i would've given them a shot, but my true size was a really poor fit.",3
144,47,,,12
144,48,Meh,"I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful, the embroidery is well done, the fabric is soft, and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath, but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.",1
144,48,"Super cute and flow, perfect for summer","I wanted this top ever since i saw it online, it is so me. it's a nice mix of feminine and masculine, you can pair it with a nice pair of jeans or even business pants to dress it up. this will make the perfect summer shirt and it hangs so nicely! i highly recommend this shirt, i would get it before its gone!",3
144,48,Very cute but harder to wear than i expected,"This top is so cute and i immediately had to purchase it when i saw it. i am usually drawn to boxy, cropped shirts, but i find this is harder to wear than i anticipated. it may be because i got a small size, but it is boxier than i anticipated and is almost hard to wear with even jeans. i recommend you buy because the detailing is so pretty and perfect, but try on and make sure you have some good bottoms to pair it with!",1
144,49,"Adorable, runs large","This top has a nice quality feel to it with natural fibers and i love the pom poms. however, it does have a roomy fit, so you might want to size down. as a petite person, i have a tendency to get lost in very billowy styles. overall, comfortable and cute and a nice rich blue color.",1
144,49,Not doing anything for me,"Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice.",1
144,50,Beautiful but....,"......not for the long waisted. i immediately ordered this top when i saw it online. the embroidery is beuatiful (although it will require extra care). the soft lavendar color was a breathe of fresh air. however, i felt like i was wearing a maternity top as it hung oddly on my slim, 5'9"" frame. i am long waisted so perhaps petites will find this top works for them. i agree with the other reviewer that indicated the arm openings are a bit large and deep. sadly, this one went back....",2
144,50,Fun summer top,Love it!! it does run big so i had to return for smaller size. fabric is nice very true to picture,3
144,51,Bright but boxy,"There is simply no way to wear a bra with this top. that being said, the cotton is substantive and crisp, the embroidery striking, the coral color bright and summery. it hits me exactly where my hips begin to broaden, which i honestly kind of hate, but the top is so lovely no one's going to be assessing your hips. if you have narrow hips and perky breasts, though, what a perfect summer top (although, i suppose if those are your features every top is perfect!)",4
144,51,Nice fit,This blouse has a nice casual feel with feminine lines and the swingy design is flattering.,0
144,51,O.m.g. soooo beautiful,"I saw this top at my local retailer and instantly fell in love. i didn't even try it on first because i just ""knew"". when i finally got home and tried it on, it didn't disappoint. ultra feminine and sexy at the same time. the delicate high neck, coupled with the exposed cut in shoulders really sold this for me. then, you come to appreciate the beautiful sewn in flowers. loved this one....so much prettier in person than online.",0
144,51,Sotra tank,"Nice quality, beautiful colors. so nice i bought another as a gift.",0
144,53,Just beautiful,This top is delicate and so feminine. it is beautiful. does run small. i had to size up. i'm usually a 6-8 m and had to buy l. it has no stretch.  so i needed room for movement.,8
144,53,So beautifully done...,"This is a lovely, well-fitting, embroidered, navy tank, i cannot find a flaw in this. i am 5'5, 142 lbs., 34d and the size 6 is a fantastic fit. one of those tops that is so well-cut that it feels as if one is wearing nothing. the lining is impeccably done and is cut perfectly for the blouse. it has a small cut-out in the back at the v. it fits just as the photo shows and is so versatile-it can be worn with everything from jeans to a formal skirt. six stars!",0

144,55,Sweet top,This a beatifully made top - it does run large so i sized down. it has a very floaty quality but it truly lovely so i kept it and glad i did - i've had many compliments! have run a ribbon through the holes around the waist once to pull it in and it worked really well - it's convertible!,1
144,56,Beautiful but wide,"I see other reviewers are like me. we are wondering why antho has so many waistless, big, flowy tops! please! more tops with a defined waist! please!
i love this top. it's a gorgeous color and a lot of work to it, very retro antho, not just a t-shirt like so many are these days. to my delight, it runs large. i usually wear a 14 or 16, but the store had a 12 in the sale room, and not only did it fit, but i plan to have my seamstress taper the waistline and cut off the ""wings"" that flare off on t",1
144,56,Sleeves are really small,This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.,0
144,56,Super cute,I bought this today in a size 2. fits perfect. i am normally a 0 or 2 or xs. the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested. because it is not long in the front. i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front. it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing. it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape. it is on the shorter side. very nice material and design as well as details. overall good pick.,7
144,56,Unexpectedly had to have it,"I love this top and despite the higher price point, it came home with me. normally i tend to go for very basic colors - white, black, gray. but i saw this and was intrigued by the high neck and subtle cut away sleeveless style. tried it on and it was love. the fit is great. it is flowey, but without the maternity look in front and all that extra fabric in the back. it's just right. i love the print and i am so not a print person. i tried it on with some taupe skinny jeans and a denim jacket. per",2
144,56,Very large; lace is kinda coarse,"Thought i'd love this top; i'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer.  but i found the lace, while pretty, to be quite rough, which to me indicates a lower quality. and i guess i should've known that it would be very swingy (photos show that) but it really overwhelmed me.  for reference, 5'5"", 125 lbs, 34d. sad, but this went back.",0

144,67,Unique style and embroidery,"This top fits loosely through the body and a little snigger in the bust. fabric is nice but does require some ironing/steaming at times. it is a little pricey but you won't find anything similar so being unique makes it worth the cost. i ordered online but it was available at my local retailer store; unfortunately the online order didn't show availability & i would have liked to see it first since i was unsure of size ( usually wear medium if top has a relaxed fit, large if not). very cute too!",2
144,75,Disappointing,"I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen, in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover, the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.
overpriced, to boot.
obviously, mine is a minority opinion.",5

146,42,"Very pretty, just not for me","I've been eyeing this dress for a while now. i decided to purchase it in the rose color, which has absolutely beautiful embroidery. here's why i will most likely return this dress: i'm 5'7"" and it is very short on me (almost like a long shirt), it is extremely roomy, so it doesn't flatter me in any way. if it belt it, it gets even shorter, and the embroidery gets a bit lost in the folds. i'm sad to return it, but i will wait for the next wow piece rather than have this sit in my closet.",0

147,24,Great basic tank,I'm always on the hunt for good white blouses to pair with business casual attire or everyday wear. this was a great tank. i love the fabric. it's nice and sturdy and you don't have to worry about wearing a cami beneath it. this fabric does wrinkle some so bear that in mind. i really like the shape of the top near the shoulders. it's a great conservative cut. the little criss cross detail on the back adds a bit of charm to the top. i would definitely recommend this to others.,1

147,30,Great color!,"This shirt was exactly what i was looking for. it's fitted at the top with just the right amount of swing. some of retailer's shirts can have too much swing for me, but this is just right. the color is great too!",0
147,30,Went back for more,"I originally bought this tunic in black, and loved it so much i bought the rose as well. normally tunics make me look like a box, but the tie on this one makes it super flattering.",0
147,31,Elegant,"I got this top in white and absolutely love it. the top can be tucked in or worn out, it is very elegant and will go well with skirts as well as pants and even jeans. can't wait to wear it.",0
147,31,Flattering fit,"I loved this top! the cinched in waist is so flattering. or i'll leave it un-cinched for a super relaxed fit. it's comfortable and light weight so i'll be wearing this into late spring/ early summer. i've worn it with the green pilcro slim pants, i've worn it unbuttoned over a basic black knee length jersey dress, i've worn it over a bathing suit in west palm beach. i can't wait to find more fun ways to wear it!",12
147,32,Awful fit,Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.,0
147,32,"Perfect fit, cute for summer","I'm a big fan of maeve products. still, even when i like something, i always prefer to try on in the store just to be certain. i decided to risk it this time and was so happy when this top came and it fit perfectly. i'm 5'3, 150 lbs but carry more weight on bottom so i ordered the 8. it's just right--cute and flowy. i'll probably get another one in a different color!",5

147,33,Patchwork denim tank,"I took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one. i've been eyeing this online for quite some time, so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price. it came in the mail the other day. it's like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door, however, this time wasn't so great. the top is fine. average at best. the top fits true to size. maybe it's the pattern or the cut, but it didn't work well on my body. i recommend trying this on first.",6
147,33,Versatile blouse!,"Agree with other contributer - this is a great piece to snag on sale. i bought this 2 months post partum with the intention of hiding the post baby belly - which is does well! i think it fits true to size (i'm typically l and this l fit well). i can see how certain body types it would look maternity, but i'm short and curvy and the blouse is flattering. it's lightweight, so i plan to add a cardigan in the fall/winter.",0

sizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.
major pass.",0
147,34,Beautiful but very fragile,"In retailer's defense, silk chiffon in general is super fragile. got the top in turquoise and the color and design are beautiful!! i'm 5'3 117 lbs and took an xs, fits true to size. i'm able to wear a nude strapless bra with the top and looks great. i have worn the top a couple of times and by the end of the day i had a few snags. i was able to pull the thread back inside the top, never ever cut silk chiffon. i love the top so much, i bought a second one in the same color and size as a back up. un",0
147,34,Maeve...has failed on this,"Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. usually fall in love with a blouse, only to look at the tag and discover it's by maeve (go figure).
this top is just atrocious though. does nothing for girls with a larger chest. very boxy and unflattering. gorgeous colors though, and the sleeve concept is cute. however, where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on. not impressed.",2
147,34,,"Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well, it really did not lay right on me. i'm a 34d, and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big, the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me.",0
147,34,,"I ordered the black and it was a soft black, which i loved. i felt like the shirt was a little boxy (i was hoping the top would have been a bit more fitted (the arm holes are loose) and the bottom a little longer, but i like it enough that i am keeping it. works well to wear to work.",0
147,35,Simple and elegant,"I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant. only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors- otherwise the shirt will snag. and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes. lots of bra showing- not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan. but it would be nice not to have to. 
other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything.",0
147,35,So cute and unique!,"I saw the black in store and had to try on. it is very, very cute. i would say it fits a bit small. i tried my usual medium and while it fit, it was a little short. id take you could take your regular size or size up. i would not size down in this one. adding to my wish list and hoping it sticks around til sale time!",2
147,35,,"Like a baby doll top, with almost an empire waist going on.  feels comfortable and super flowy. i got a size m and i swing between m and l in most brands. the button stitching are a bit loose and will fray after some wears, i can tell. but i'm borderline on taking it back still because there are hidden side pockets! crazy--like it was a fluke or something. would fit a piece of paper or tissues. not keys or phones though.",0

147,36,I really wanted to love this top!,"I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back, it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept, just didn't work for me.",0

147,36,,"Nice, flowy, comfy top with soft fabric. there's a lot of fabric below the waist - it could probably work as a maternity top - but it drapes nicely rather than looking overwhelming. i do find that the buttons gap a little at the chest, despite the top fitting loosely on me, so i have to wear a layer under it.",0
147,37,Awkward fitting,"First, the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top, but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs, and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.",0
147,37,Comfortable style,"Such a great purchase! the fit is so flattering to my 5'3"" frame. i usually wear an extra small/small, but i opted for an extra small after reading a review; i'm glad i did. i also did not get the petite, but i imagine it would have a similar fit without the length this has. it flows, yet hits my curves in all the right places. i will say, i'm a c cup and if you have larger breasts, the extra small may not accommodate them as it is just right on me. the black is so slimming especially when pared",0
147,37,Cute,"I'm small (4'11, 98 pounds and 34a) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me.  i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath (or i can wear the tunic by itself) and leggings plus a pair of boots.  the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting, is size down to xxs.  i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon.  the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water.  i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it (i put",3
147,37,Lovely drape in your regular size,"I originally purchased this in my usual retailer size 6 (vanity size lol), and was nervous that the neck would be tight, based on the other reviews. however, once i tried it on i realized that in my usual size the body was a little too wide and didn't create any shape. i ended up exchanging for and keeping a size 4 and it fits much better in the body and i did not have a problem with any tightness in the neck in either size. for reference i'm 5'7"", 36dd 135lbs.

i would say this items runs true",15
147,37,Short but wide,"This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot, it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.",0

147,38,Beautiful blouse; very flattering,"Overall, gorgeous blouse; very flattering. i love the sleeves; very unique and also flattering. i love how the blouse is a fit-and-flare from the bust. it's fitted at the bust (but not tight) and drapes with an a-line style. the fit of this blouse is truly flattering to the figure. no issues with inappropriate amounts of cleavage showing or anything. the ties are weighted on the end with metal tubes, which i really like because it makes the strings drape nicely. the back drapes beautifully. i fe",29

147,39,Just sew the gap,"Being a 34d, i was nervous about the gaping between the top two buttons given the other reviews i read. they're right - it totally gaps even when standing still. so i took it to the tailor. they sewed the seam between the top two buttons. easy fix for a blouse that otherwise works. the color is great (i got the red one) and i like the fabric. i didn't think it hit awkwardly at the bottom seam. looks great with skinny white jeans.",2
147,39,Lovely colors but boxy,"I had the priviledge of trying this on during the 20% off tops sale, too bad but the store only had regualr sizes, and xs was the smallest. i am not super tiny (read have muscles), but this looked huge on me. love the colros and textures though, the line in the back is pretty and adds charm when you turn around, and the combo of all the colros is awesome, but i would need a xxs or perhaps a petite (though it is short, so not sure about petite)... soft, but try a smaller size...",4

147,39,So cute,This top is so cute.  i love it and get tons of compliments on it.,0
147,39,Wrong button choice,I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,3

love the concept but thought the material was too stiff to be a 'swing' tank. the pleats in the back poke up when you move or bend as if you've got little horns coming out of your back. i think a chambray, like cloth and stone produces might have rendered this super cute design better (imo).

fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back - my usual size in a fitted top (this one is very fitted in the waist and bust) is a 12. i tried the 12 and 14, and the side zipper wouldn't come near closing. it is very, very nipped right under the bust.
so, if you have no bustline and a super small waist, this top is for you. if you are like me, high waist and straight up and down, this is a pass. in fact, it is really h",6

148,26,Detail ripped,"I got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped. the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i don't think it was a case of it being too small. i guess it just wasn't reinforced enough. there was also a miss-stitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily. lastly, there's a slip on the inside which i don't think was necessary. it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy.",0

148,29,Great summer staple!,"I bought the orange version during the tag sale and was so pleasantly surprised when it arrived. it fits very well and is made from thick, high quality material. i only wish they had more colors! 
sizing--i bought the 2p and it fits well, although a 0p may have fit better. the dress is fairly low cut on me, although i am small chested, but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing it to work.",0

148,29,Runs a bit large,,1
148,29,Runs small,"Agree with other reviewers: this runs narrow in the skirt. the top is also quite low-cut, and it's already lined so i can't see wearing a cami or slip. i like the black-and-white print and the shape, and might have tried a size larger in the store. finally, it's an awkward, unflattering length. i'm 5'4"" and it hit below my knee.",0
148,29,Runs very small,"A cute dress, though waist a little too high (more of an empire waist... hitting at widest part of rib cage). this looks like it should be a stretchy knit dress, but the detailing has no give whatsoever and the dress runs quite small. i usually wear a 00, but though i could get it zipped, it wasn't comfortable, and if i want to keep it, i'll need to size up to a 0. i'm 5'6"", 32b-24-35.",26
148,29,Seriously comfortable with vivid colors!,"This dress has a really lovely design and is very, very comfortable. it is not quite as flattering as i had hoped, and doesn't have quite as defined a shape as i expected. still, it's cute and i'm happy to have it!",0

148,30,A perfect investment,"I walked into retailer with low hopes of finding a dress for a friend's spring wedding, as a lot of this season's dresses are more casual, but was drawn to this pretty number for multiple reasons: it can certainly be dressed up or down depending upon accessories, the fabric feels incredible, it has pockets, and it's really fun yet classy as heck. typically i wear a 10/m in dresses, but they only had a 12 in store, so i took it and made it work by tightening the sash a bit extra and wearing a bra w",1
148,30,"Adorable, timeless, versatile",I was drawn to the green/blue color in store! it's so cute and comfortable. i'm usually a size 2/4 and needed the 2. the bodice is flattering and the length was perfect on me. i'm even 4 months pregnant with my 2nd baby and this will work with my growing belly for another month or so. it's got great stretch!,0
148,30,Bad fit for me,"This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length, color, and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online, so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed, but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice, and the color is lovely.",0
148,30,Comfy and cute,"I tried this on in the store and was pleasantly surprised at how cute it was! i'm 5'4"" and the large fits me loosely but is still shapely. because it's a little longer on me, it's great to wear both to work and on the weekends. just wish it came in more colors! you can't see the color in the photo, but there's a sea green lining which is a cute touch!",5
148,30,Cute dress with faulty zipper,This is a beautiful dress. i sized up 2 sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it's a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.,1
148,30,Fit and flattering,"Gorgeous dress. ordered the orange in an xs. i'm usually a small in retailer but the reviews accurately assessed this dress to run large. i'm 5'7"" about 140lbs and this dress is just above my knee. very flattering and feminine. only issue is that the bottom is a thin material that can be see through in the right light...",1

148,30,Looks better in person,Bought this dress for a wedding in petite. fits true to size. beading & embroidery is beautiful in person. only downside is that the beads & embroidery are very delicate and damage even when sitting on a chair.,0
148,30,Omg the best dress,"This is the best dress. i received it last week and have already worn it three times. perfect fit. casual and so easy but the length and front details make it so fun. thicker than many other ""tshirt"" dresses... but light enough that i wasn't overly hot on super warm days. def recommend!!!!",2
148,30,The dress fits nicely,"This dress is so soft! the dress hangs really well across the front and hides your stomach area a bit. you can wear a regular bra with this dress as well. 
the downside to this dress is that is shows the slightest liquid and stains very easily. wore this on a hot day and the slightest sweat showed. in addition, the front drape across the chest can gape open and show your bra. 
overall, i really love the fit of this dress.",3

148,31,Best dress ever,"I got this dress in pxxs in the gray color, i am 5'4"", 100lbs, petite frame, and it fits like a dream. true to size. the fabric is super soft and thick, drapes well, not too tight, and u can wear a regular bra!!!. length is also perfect, no shortening required (which is rare for me - this could be an issue for tall girls but i wouldnt know about that). it looks great with dressy flip flops for any summer occasion, can be casual or dressy depending on accessories. great purchase, 100% recommend.",0

148,31,Lovely. size up...maybe twice.,"This dress is so lovely in person, with more muted colors than pictured which will transition nicely into fall.  the overall cut of the dress is really flattering, especially for hourglass/ pear figures.  sadly, i had to return the dress because the arms were insanely small.  i after putting the dress on, i was worried i wouldn't be able to actually get it off.  if you have teeny, tiny arms...you'll probably be okay with your regular size.  if you have any kind of muscle (or squish :)), size up.",0

148,31,"Neat fabric, but too much poof!","I loved the blue brocade since it's a little unusual, paired with a top that brings an otherwise formal fabric into something you could wear out to dinner, plus a little pop of extra color from the ribbon! my biggest fear ordering online was that the top would look cheap - fortunately it doesn't. the top of the dress was fitted (i wore my usual size). what i didn't expect, though, is the skirt is really poofs out a lot below the ribbon, which runs just below the bust. the photo online shows a li",0

148,31,Pretty in pictures - awkward in person,"Although this is a very lovely dress in the pictures, and it has a lovely quality in person, the shape and orientation of the dress is very awkward. the attached slip makes it tricky to put on, and the sizing between the top and the hips seems inconsistent (tight in the hips, large in the top). not quite for my body type - maybe better for someone with slim hips and a bigger bust.",10
148,31,Terrible for my body type,"I'm surprised this worked for so many people. for me, this dress fit terribly. however, the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made. i am 5'3"" and about 117 with a really short torso, and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have. i think the bodice was just too long for me. the neckline was also too low. on someone taller, or maybe with a longer torso, i could see this dress being really lovely.",0

148,32,Beautiful dress!,"Very lovely print and fabric, there is more gray to the print's background than the photo shows. the shape is feminine and flattering, although the sleeves are more fitted on my arms. i bought this to wear to an early fall rehearsal dinner. very happy with the purchase!",0
148,32,Comfortable and flattering,"I got this dress in green and it looks better in person than it even does in the online picture. the fabric is soft and flattering. i am pear shaped so a lot of things don't look good around my waist, but this worked beautifully. the only thing is that i can't get the slight wrinkles out of the bottom. i washed it and lined dried it and some still show. the care says not to iron. a steamer would probably work well on this. the slight wrinkles are not an issue for me though. well worth it and a g",0
148,32,Curvy girls beware,"This dress is such a beautiful color and the fabric is super soft and lovely. it would be stunning on someone with a slim figure, but since i've got curves/an athletic build, it simply did not work. too bad, because it is such a pretty dress!",0
148,32,Great dress,"This is a great dress - it definitely runs true to size and is on the border of running a little small. if you're on the fence about which size to order go with the larger size.
the fabric moves nicely but wrinkles easily when packed. love the color.
got a ton of compliments :)",2
148,32,Killer dress,"I am 5'8"", about 140, athletic build. i purchased this dress for business meetings and such. i was worried the dress was going to be too low cut but i  am small chested so i can wear lower cuts without exploding out of it. luckily this is the case here too! the dress has a professionally sexy look which i love. nice fabric, good quality. happy i bought it!",0

148,32,Ripped after one wear,"I have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events.  this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality.  however, the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding.  the size 4 seemed to fit perfectly, but the fabric had no give.  it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size 34aa.  for the price, i expected better.  the color and style of the dress is gorgeous, so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer. . .",0

148,32,So flattering!,"I bought this dress to wear for our upcoming family pictures. i don&#39;t think the image does the dress justice - the fit is so flattering and slimming. i feel like it can easily be dressed down too, with a cute jacket in either denim or leather. the material is thinner, and it does wrinkle a bit. the price tag is a tad high also for a thin maxi dress, but i just had to have it. :)",0
148,32,This will be a summer staple!,"I love this dress. it is loose fitting so be prepared for that. i ordered an xs. i believe the dress was intended to fit this way though and i do not think it looks too big on me. i typically wear a 0 or 00 in dresses. this would be a great dress to wear if you were planning on eating a big meal, ha. i can't wait to wear this dress in the summer and believe i will wear it often. it has more of a boho look to it. i do think it could be worn with heels though. i will probably wear it with flat gol",0

pros:
- the jeweled neckline is lovely! it really helps set the dress apart.
- pockets!!! such an elegant dress to have pockets is a huge plus in my book. :)
- the length is ideal for taller folk.
- it swings beautifully on the body and flares out quite a bit on the bottom. if you're tall as i am, this won't be an issue.
- nicely conservative at the top.

cons:

148,34,Gorgeous!!!,This dress is absolutely beautiful! it fits like a glove and the material is super soft. so in love with this! i'm 5'2'm and normally a xs/s. the xspwas a better fit in the waist and chest. the arm holes were a bit tighter on me. the sp was way too large.,18
148,34,Not good,I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.,0
148,34,Perfect fall dress,I almost didn't try this dress. i walked by it a few times and am so glad i gave it a try! the fit is amazing. so flattering. the color and material for fall is perfect. it looks great with booties and heels.,0

148,35,Clean and cute,"I love this dress. i got the coral, and it's clean and simple, but with visually interesting lines. the top is a slightly heavier, stretchy fabric (no zippers or closures), while the skirt is made of a lighter fabric that gives it a bit of flirty swing. the hem is also slightly a-symmetrical, which i didn't notice from the online pictures. it's a very comfortable dress that i could see being very versatile - dressed up for work, dressed down for daytime weekend wear, or even for date night.

148,35,Gorgeous dress!,"I love this dress. the fabric is a little heavy, so it won't blow away on a windy day (and bonus, even with my triple d chest i'm comfortable not wearing a bra with this) but may not be what you want to wear on a really hot day. the shape is flattering on any body type-i am 6 months pregnant and it still looks great. it can go from spring to summer to fall quite easily, with the addition of a jean jacket and some converse or vans instead of sandals. i'd absolutely recommend this dress.",1
148,35,Great dress for all occasions,"Another great dress by retailer. i've worn it with tall boots with heels, riding boots and booties...all look really good. i've also added a cream/beige cardigan and even a fuzzy/furry vest. very versatile. the only few things that i would have liked even more is that design of the dress be actual stitching and not just a flat print and also the material does shrink a tat when you wash it. it's a staple and keeper.",0

148,36,Cute dress,I loved this dress immediately.  i got the blue and orange and love the combination of the top fabric and the flowy skirt.  only one complaint.  it's a bit short on one side so i'll have to wait for cooler weather to wear it with tights (if i want to wear it to work).,0

148,36,Nod to mod,"I love the weight of this dress, the mod color blocking, the pockets, the detail down the side of the skirt, the cable knit, everything! i wear it with a caramel cardigan and brown booties, it's perfect. it's a sin to pass it up, especially for this price.",0
148,36,Nothing special,"I tried this dress on in the store. it looked frumpy. the ruching was not flattering. the fabric felt cheap. i think for the price there are plenty of other options for dresses than can give you a ""wow"" look. i'm 5'1"" 107lbs and the 0p fit fine.",0
148,36,"Super comfortable, nice quality, overpriced","This dress fit perfectly, i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well. i do however think that the dress is over priced. for as often as you would wear this dress (given that isn't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once) i think the price is way too high.

148,36,Super comfy dress,"I ordered a regular size xs and the length is still fine for me at 5'2"". i love the color and the fabric is super soft and comfortable. i'll get a lot of use out of it this summer and the sale price is a great bargain!",1

148,36,,"This dress is so flattering, not the usual type of dress i go for, but decided on a whim to try and am glad so glad i did. the material has enough heft to give you a beautiful silhouette without being too clingy. you can dress up or down, if you don;t like showing too much cleavage you may want to put a tank underneath to give you a little coverage.",3
148,36,,"This is the dress that i have been waiting for all season. perfect color. the material is also ""firm"" without being heavy or thick (if you know what i mean). it lays flat and smooths out any bumps without being overly stiff. the v-neck is also not too deep and the sleeves are not too short. overall, a complete win. now go and make it in gray and navy blue please.",32

148,37,Absolutely perfect,This dress is the perfect combination of beauty and comfort. the quality is excellent with a forgiving fit. it could be paired with black heels for a formal look or flats for a an easy date night. i just cannot say enough positive things about it!,0
148,37,Bautiful lines,"This dress hung so nicely on my figure (small up top, bigger in the hips) that i couldn't pass it up. the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos. it might run a little small...i'm normally an extra small, but it was a little snug in the arms. however, the small was too big, so i would suggest sticking with your usual size. the saleslady said would stretch a little. i would have loved to try a petite, but the store didn't carry petite sizes. it will be my go-to holiday dress.",2

148,37,It's worth a look,"The cut and design of this dress is lovely! the fabric is heavy enough for fall/winter, but the sleeveless style makes it a great transition piece for when the weather warms up again. it does run slightly larger than most other retailer dresses. i sized down to a 2 from a 4. the bust stretches a bit for the ladies who might be heavier on top (i'm a 34 dd), however, i noticed the white shows through in dark places around my bust. also, the boning in the front pushed against the fabric a bit",0

148,37,Not a true medium but lovely!,"My husband bought it for me and i was a bit skeptical at first. tried it on and absolutely loved it. besides the really soft fabric, it has pockets which makes it even more comfortable for me! i'm 5'8"", 123lbs. and flat chested. he got me a medium, which fits a bit tight, but my husband likes it so it's a keeper!",1
148,37,Perfect comfy little dress,"Just picked this up at the store 40% off sale price, well worth it! the petite hits perfect on my 5'3"" frame, right about where it hits the model in the pic. very well made good quality piece i can see myself wearing quite often.",0
148,37,Perfect for hourglass,"I tried on this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love! i'm a bigger gal who is busty and have wider hips. this dress made me look and feel slimmer, and is light to wear. the dress is a perfect length too. i'm 5'11 and this dress hits me right at the ankles. if your looking for a long dress to wear that can be either formal or casual, this one is perfect!",12

148,38,Just not for me,"I really love this dress, just not on me! i am very curvy, with a rounder stomach. i normally wear a 10 (5'8, 160lbs), and the 10 fit, but it is so fitted that i didn't like how it showed everything. if i had a flatter stomach, i would have kept it, but it just doesn't work on my body style unless i wanted to constantly be pulling it down (it was riding up a bit). the fabric is great, the color and pattern are so lovely i almost ignored my instinct and kept it anyway (my boyfriend, who is picky,",0
148,38,Love it!,"Love it! i usually wear a small but i just went to our local store and they only had a medium. i tried it on just in case and it fit perfectly. it is sitting pretty in my closet now. :) so if you are a size small, try ordering a medium and i hope it works for you as well.",2
148,38,Not as nice in person,"The design looked super cute online, but in person, the material seemed cheap. actually, at least in the green one, the material is different in the striped and solid sections; if it had all been the striped material, it would have been much nicer.",25

148,39,Perfection,"I think i'm on the opposite side of the fence when it comes to fit, because i love this dress. it may be because i don't have much hips or curve to my waist that this dress is not tight as it is on others. it does make me look like i have some shape down there because it doesn't cling. i ordered the holly green and i adore the shoulder detail. confused as to why that same detail follows along around the inside of the dress across the shoulders because it itches a little. i do have to wear a cami",0

148,45,"For curvy or tall, not for the waist challenged","The fabric, so diaphanous! so flowy! the pattern, so pretty with such interesting colors. it could literally go with anything! purple, yellow, orange, green, they're all in there. but here's the but....

i have no waist! and when you put this type of empire silhouette on me, i look like i'm wearing a sack, or i have some pregnancy news--when i don't. i tried belting it : waist tie is too high; i tried putting on a vest, too annie hall and called too much attention to the sleeves, while adding",5
148,45,Great dress,"Love the fabric and design of this dress, very unique and comfortable. it is not lined, which explains the lower price when compared to other well fashioned dresses. i wore it successfully with stockings and no slip and it did not ride up or cling strangely. the fabric is stretchy and form fitting without feeling tight. the ribbons that define the detail around the waist were a bit snug but we're not uncomfortable. they define the waist very well. i am 5'7'',127lbs, athletic build and the 4 fit",3
148,45,Great dress,"This dress is adorable and professional at the same time. i was worried that the print would overpower me but it's a nice fabric. i'm 5'2"" and the petite small is perfect. i don't like to wear form fitting clothing for work and this fits right for me. plus it's hand washable. i haven't worn or washed it yet but i'll easily wear it to my ""creative professional"" workplace.",2

gorgeous dress- wish it were just a little less costly, but would be a great purchase for easter, weddings, etc.",3
148,45,It won't fit over the chest,"I saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it. they had an extra large, i usually wear a large, and i thought it would perfect with some leggings. i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance. my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldn't fit it past her chest either. we flipped it inside out and couldn't find a zipper. maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small. it's too bad, it looked adorable and i was so excited to try",0
148,45,Not what i hoped for,"The color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft. but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it. i wanted to love it, but it just wasn't working for me. i'm 5'8"" and purchased a s. it fits true to size, however it was loose around the waist and just wasn't complimentary on me. this will have to go back.",1
148,45,"Pattern is beautiful, just to-die","This is a shift dress, which is a great dress for many people, in a kind of man-repeller way. by saying that, i mean, a really pretty dress that can show off amazing shoes, good legs, a beautiful face and hair. this is not a body con dress. however, when you do such a high neckline and boxy sleeves, you do no one any favors. everyone has a nice neck and decolletage and collarbone. everyone. the neckline needs to open up a bit....i'm not saying v-neck, just a bit lower than this, because it makes",0

148,46,"Pretty, but very big","I am not one to complain about things being cut too big as i generally don't mind lose and flowing. however, this dress is very ""bell"" shaped and the fabric is just thick enough that it doesn't really lay well, at least not like it does in the photo. i bought the earth-tone color way and i felt like i was wearing a macrame version of the liberty bell. it is also a lot shorter than i was expecting. if it weren't so short, i would try sizing down. it is very good quality and the slip is super soft",1

(the 0 fit me everywhere else, which is why i'm saying this dress runs small.) would it have worked with a padded bra, or for someone with more cup size?",9
148,47,Cute dress,The dress is true to fit and very soft. you can dress it up or be casual with a denim jacket.,0
148,47,Gorgeous but runs small,"As in the other review, this dress runs small. i'm usually an 8 but it was tight and short. i would love to exchange for a 10 but it's out of stock. the beading and the colors on this dress are breathtaking...i was so disappointed it didn't fit! the background is more taupe/nude than cream which i actually really like.",1
148,47,Nice,Heavier fabric than it looks but cute and versatile. flattering as well!,0

148,47,"Very pretty, but too pricey","This dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice. it does have an a-line fit in the skirt. the stitching is beautiful. honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me. some may like that, but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted. the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress. the fabric is cotton and it is not lined. i am 5'9"" and it does hit right about where it does on the model. i am sending it back, because i didn't say ""wow, i love this"" w",4

148,48,Love it!,Tried this lovely navy dress on in the store in a size 6 and it was perfect. wish there had been a petite available to try since the hem fell below the knees on me and it would have to be hemmed. the crisscross on the front is very flattering to the waistline and i love the see through fabric along the shoulders and back. it's stretchy too!,3
148,48,Luv this dress!,"I saw this dress in the window at the roc center nyc store and knew i had to have it. the one i chose has muted earth-tone colors of tan, green, gold. looks stunning with my complexion. the blue one was nice too, but the earth tones were more flattering on me.  the fit is loose and flowy, very comfortable, but not baggy. i'm 5'5, 34c, 115ish and i took my usual xs. i plan to pair it with a muted green leather jacket and brown boots for the fall. can't wait!",10
148,48,Pretty and easy,"Really love the pattern and color combination. the dress has an attached lining to around the knee. i would say this is tts or a little big. i'm 5'8"" and around 135 and size s fits well with a bit of extra room around the waist. print and fabric cover any perceived flaws and create a long, lean look. i love the feeling of effortlessness--with cute sandals this is an outfit.",36

148,48,"Pretty, but stiff",This dress you will want to try on in the store. it is very thick and stiff fabric. the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam. there is absolutely no give in that waist. this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear. sad because it is very pretty on the rack!,5
148,48,Striking and adorable,,5
148,48,Stylish jumpsuit!,"Really liked the styling on this jumpsuit. it looks great on, the lattice back is unusual. i had been looking for a little black jumpsuit for the longest time and this fits the bill. just wish the fabric wasn't polyester. on the down side the top buttons are really hard to put on and take off. if you take care of your nails, it could do a number on them. the bottom buttons are easier. can only imagine a struggle when trying to take this off in an emergency bathroom break!",15
148,48,Versatile dress,"This dress is very versatile - it will be cool and comfortable in the summer, but one could also wear it with leggings or skinny jeans in the winter with a sweater or jacket. it can be worn casually with a belt, or dressed up with a statement necklace and earrings for a night out. the black color is more like a charcoal grey, which suits me fine. grab it while you can - it's a good deal for the current sale on sale price!",0

148,49,"Sadly, not for the curvy","This dress is really beautiful. very well made and high quality fabrics. unfortunately, it is cut very narrow. i am between sizes, ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small. i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge. if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you.",11
148,49,,"I so wanted to love this little dress, but it just didn't fit my body well. as suggested by others, i ordered a size up, and it did fit. the fabric is stretchy, so there is some give there, but the size zip was a little sticky, because the trim causes a lot of fabric to be bunched along the zipper. the real problem was that the dress was too short-waisted for me. the waist band came right under my chest. maybe this would fit someone with a small-or mid-sized bust better than it did me. i also th",0

148,50,Super flattering and comfortable,"This dress is of great quality and design. the lines and the way the dress shapes your body are perfect throughout the entire dress. i am short and it is a little long on me; it is between my calf and my ankle, but the way it flatters in the bust and waist more than makes up for it. with the right shoes, it is a real winner! i think this dress would be flattering on every body type. highly recommend!",3
148,50,Surprisingly very pleased!,"I bought this dress online last week (in large part based on all the positive reviews), then i saw it in the store. i didn't try it on because it was already on the way to me and i had ordered a petite anyway and the store didn't carry petites. i have to say when i saw it hanging in the store i was disappointed! for some reason i didn't realize it was a sweater dress and it looked frumpy on the hanger. so i had resigned myself to returning it once i received it. well it came today and i figured",1

148,51,Great dress !,"Love everything about this dress -- i ordered the 'red' which is more of a 'red orange' / with cream and beige - as pictured, colors are beautiful. the dress has a nice 'drape' / great feel, love it !",0
148,51,Hoped this was the dress for summer,I have several maeve dresses that fit really well. this was not the case with this dress. fabric and color are great! fit was off especially in top. worst part was zipper that wouldn't move smoothly. took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped. such a bummer!,3
148,51,Love!,,4
148,51,Ribbing at neck and sleeve ruins the look for me,"This dress didn't work for me for several reasons, but i knew i wouldn't keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms, which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress (dress up/dress down) into super casual only (plus it looks cheap). it is also not for the long waisted or tall.

on the plus side, the fabric feels great, and it hangs well.",23
148,51,Wanted to love,This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.,3

148,53,Super simple summer style,"I am so pleased with this midi dress; i've already worn and laundered this dress multiple times and i cannot express how comfortable and cute this dress is to wear. best of all, the fabric is just substantial enough that there are no posterior lumps or panty lines that are visible and the v-neck is just low enough to provide a subtle sexy dã©colletage. i love the length of this dress as i really dislike my knobby knees and this exposes enough leg from the sides and disguises the ugly knees for me",8

148,57,Great dress,"The fabric is a nice weight jersey. i prefer to wear the dress backwards as the back of the dress has a moderate v and the round neck (which is actually the front of the dress) makes for a very flattering back. the skirt part of the dress is full but the jersey fabric falls in such a way that does not cause the silhouette to look ""hippy"". this is not a dress that fits close to the body through the torso, so if you're looking for that you might consider going down a size.",32

151,44,"Soft, snuggly and cute","Like the previous reviewer stated, it's more like a cape. i'd to call it a cape-digan. style: super comfy, loose fit for comfort. fabric: high quality, just right thickness (not too thick, not too thin), snuggly soft, doesn't pill with wear. design: totally retailer cute and quirkiness, top of the back has the same gray as the sleeve for continuity, and the sleeve has sheep and a fence (how cute is that!). this is a very versatile sweater, goes with everything, and so comfortable that i reach for",2
151,44,This is a poncho,"Was really looking forward to this sweater, but it's not a cardigan, it's a poncho. i can't decide if it's fun-quirky or just odd. it's gorgeously made, and extremely soft, but i do wish it was actually sleeves. i haven't decided if it's something i will wear or not. my husband referred to it as ""batwings."" that should have been depicted in one of the photos.",2

151,46,Cute sweater,This is a cute stylish sweater different from the typical. it doesn't itch which is key at least for me. i ordered an extra small but i am normally a small since it seems to run long. i think the neckline is unique :),3
151,46,"Didn't fit well for me, awkward and dull","I ordered this and hoped it would be a fun & whimsical sweater for this winter. instead, it's just strange. it didn't fit well. too short in the overall length & in the sleeves. the shades of the yarn were drab. it also didn't seem made to last. it looked like it would pill/snag in a short amount of time. i returned it. i'd love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future. having a unique sleeve is a cute idea.",2

151,48,Fabulous!,"I love this vest. i think it is heavy for a warm spring/summer day so kind've surprised it was featured at the store early spring. i waited for it to go on sale and purchased my normal retailer size medium. i agree it may seem big or loose fitting but i am a vest girl and the fit for me is perfect. size 34 dd, 145 lbs and 5 ft 4 in height. it is a great finishing piece for causal or office attire. this vest will definitely stay in my closet for a long time. beautiful quality.",0

151,48,Very impressed,"Picked this darling vest in a medium. i have been eyeing for sometime but really did not want to pay full price, after checking other manufactures i came back to this vest at retailer. as the other reviewers mentioned, the softness, spec of colors which enables you to wear the vest with so many colors in bottoms and tops; the pockets, the belt, which i love as much as the pockets, though the faux fur collar i do wish was removable. the faux fur will limit me in getting away with wearing this vest",1
151,49,Nice!,The sweater had a square fit it has a chiffon ruffle at the bottom which i didn't see in the picture.,0
151,50,Much prettier and more flattering than pictured!,"This sweater is really lovely. it doesn't look like it does in the picture. i got the xsmall as i was worried it would run big. it's much shorter than i though, fits more like a petite size. the sleeves are 3/4 length, which i wasn't thrill with but accepted. the color combo is really lovely! it's very comfortable and well made and it was perfect for work but lovely with a pair of jeans too!",0

151,53,Great go-to sweater,"My favorite features of this sweater are the flattering neckline and the bracelet length sleeves. it's a heavy-weight cotton with a beautiful line. my only complaint is that it seems to pick up lint and things very easily and needed a lint roller even straight out of the delivery box. still, a small issue for an easy to wear sweater that looks great with jeans and boots as well as leggings. a new favorite!",0

151,58,Lovely but...,"I thought i was getting this nice light weight white sweater but not the case.
it is a pretty heavy, nice thick cotton and beautiful made. it does run large. i got the small and love the oversize feel even on my 5'9"" frame. 
but - it is not white, it is beige, and it is not light weight. i have enough beige sweaters in this look so this one is going back, even though it was a great buy on sale.",0
151,58,"Nice style, but not on me.","I received the vest and it was pretty much as pictured however, the color isn't quite yellow; it has a little green to it, kind of chartreuse.

151,60,Super cute. true poncho style.,"I tried this on in store but didn't purchase it due to price, then kicked myself afterwards when my size was sold out online. i really wanted the gray. i finally was able to order my size when it was restocked very briefly and am so happy i did. this is such a cute poncho.

i also have the angel of the north poncho from last winter, and don't like that one nearly as much. that one was too long; this one is the perfect length. it curves down in the front and back, and then comes up at the sides r",2
151,62,Statement piece,"I bought this coat 5 years ago and every fall/winter, i can't wait to wear it again. can't even begin to describe how many people comment on how beautiful and unique it is! it has worn well over the years considering how much it has been worn, but i just might be tempted to buy it again (which is something i have never done with a statement piece). the only design feature i would change is that it has no closure. i actually had a beautiful large antique button that i sewed on with a snap and it",11
151,65,Just the cutest,"Here's the thing: i ride horses. you would think this would mean i would love this, but the first time it came around, i hesitated simply because i spent too much of my childhood in horse-bedecked things looked overwhelmingly nerdy. but this time, having actually purchased the belted navy birds version, i had to give it a try, and it's kind of a must. there is just something about the way it falls that is super flattering. it's just warm enough to serve as a jacket right now (in new england) but",0
151,65,Perfect fall cape.....easy to wear!,Love this medium weight wool cape. it is so much prettier in person. the photos look a bit boring but this cape is very versatile and simple to wear. some capes hang oddly on me but this one was flattering without the bulk. not itchy either. the photos don't really show the sleeves clearly but there is a sleeve built into the cape. the taupe color is a rich neutral that can be paired with thin or thicker turtlenecks or shirts. the sleeves are bracelet length so full length sweaters will show und,2

151,68,,"I love this sweater. i bought it in navy at this sale price and now plan on ordering it in the cream color. it runs a tad large and it might even stretch just a teensy bit (but not a lot), however i adore sweaters to be a little too big so this is perfect for me. whenever i wear this sweater i get huge compliments, to the end that the friends wants to go online and order it for herself. tkhe only problem with the sweater is that i love it so much, i want to wear it every single day (which is why",0

152,25,Poor fit,"This style of shirtdress usually fits me perfectly, however, this did not fit me one bit. the waist was too large, the length too short, and the hips too small. i was really hoping this would fit, since it's a unique color and the material is substantial but soft. i will be returning this.",6
152,27,Beautiful crafted!,Love the crochet and and it is a great feel with a liner underneath that comes with the dress. a little boxy but another beautiful retailer dress overall :),0

152,34,Almost perfect,"The cut and print of this dress is beautiful. however, the armhole is way too low, which is a reoccurring problem with anything sleeveless from retailer these days. please don't drop the armholes so low, most women do not want their bra completely showing every time you lift your arm!",0

152,36,"Beautiful, but totally see-through","This dress is elegant and really lovely. it looks like a throwback to the 20s and 30s. it drapes nicely and i think it would be flattering on most body types. and this is why i am recommending it. but be warned: it runs large.

the problem with the dress is that the slip might as well not be there at all--it is completely sheer. for example, i have a couple tattoos and you can see them right through the fabric, which is not the look i'm going for. this might be a deal breaker for some. for me, i",0

152,37,So unique and lovely!!,"This dress was returned to our store and i was intrigued the second i saw it. the dress is definitely oversized. so much so that you could probably size down a size or two. but what i love about this dress is the style. its meant to be oversized...and with the print, the asymmetric cut and the oversized look...its very unique! the color is exactly as it appears and the material is wonderful. thin but soft and comfortable...really easy to wear! you could do this as a dress, or with leggings and b",0

152,39,Gorgeous & versatile,"I love everything about this tunic dress. it's versatile and can be styled a few ways: loose like a shift, blouson when cinched, or eliminate the liner and wear as a layer over whatever you want. all the little details make it stand out and give it a glamorous bohemian vibe. there are tiny beads, sequins and subtle micro pleating. the fabric is airy and quite delicate (be careful.) the drawstrings at the waist are adjustable for both sides. slip is tts and the outer dress has a subtle oversize d",10

152,43,Meh,"This dress has very pretty colors on the embroidery, there is nothing wrong with the dress, other than the fact that there is nothing special about it. very blah fit. the fabric feels very polyester. no real shape to it. the embroidery on the dress i tried was lined up like the photo, so no problems there, just nothing about the dress made me want to wear it. perhaps at a much lower price point, but at this price point, its disappointing. size 2 fit perfectly, and i am 5'2"" 112. in general, just",1
152,45,Okay...,It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.,0

152,53,Nice summer piece,"This is a cute dress. the quality is very good for a dress of this type. the fabric is not too thin and the stitching is perfect. i do think it runs a little small. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p and i purchased this in the regular xs. regular xs is typically way too big, but i took a chance on this one because i really liked it and i also like my dresses a little bit longer than shown on the models. surprisingly, it fit well in the chest and the armholes were not too big, as is often the case",8

155,25,"Strange fit, nice fabric and stitching","I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust, 5'5"", around 116 lbs), but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn't cinch in at the waist at all, rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic ""flaps"" laid strangely as well, like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style, as i have seen a few other tops like it around, but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on",1
155,26,Nice casual top,"I like this top. it is a nice casual top. i think it looks better on the model because it looks a bit dressy. when i tried it on, it looked good but not as dressy. the embroidery on the side gives the top a nice look. i also like the tie-dye look. the price is high, i got it on sale price. the fabric is a simple t-shirt, the embroidery makes it stand out. i am keeping it.",2

155,31,Large? small? just right? a goldilocks review.,"I vacillate betwixt saying this shirt runs large and small. i usually wear a small in retailer items, but the xs was all that was left in the charming bee print. the fit is flattering even though it's smaller than my usual size. conclusion: runs large. however, when i went to put my head through the top of the shirt, it was like being birthed. conclusion: runs small. bottom line: i'm in love with this shirt and so i'll just have to get used to the faux birthing feeling every time i put it o",0

155,35,Great casual weekend or sahm shirt,"I'm a stay at home mom, always on the lookout for something casual, interesting, yet put together. it's preppy yet quirky with the embroidery. i love this shirt. great with jeans, can take you from shopping to playground and lunch without feeling under or overdressed anywhere. the sparkle from the embroidered birds gives it spunk to not make it look too boring and predictable. at the same time, it isn't something that screams, look at me! a perfect mix.",0
155,35,Horrible fit,"This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin, and this style of top is usually quite flattering, but this one missed the mark big time.",8

155,39,Lovely,"I purchased this shell in black. the embellishments and construction of the top are of a good quality, like as shown. i am 5'4"", 120# and typically purchase an xs. this ran a bit bigger than i was expecting from the reviews, but i am overall happy with the top. the center slit may be too revealing for those with a smaller bust.",0
155,43,Fun and flowy,"I love this top, but i do need to wear a navy cami underneath.  as the pic shows, the lace in the mid section makes it completely sheer in place... kinda odd placement in my opinion. but if you don't mind the sheerness or a cami, it's a great top.",0
155,43,,"I tried this on in the store and loved it. it runs large. i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, very short waisted, and i got the xs. i realized it had a sheer section on the side, but the store paired it with a beautiful scarf that helped cover the sheerness. i didn't feel i needed a cami while wearing the scarf. plus the scarf will keep me warmer and let me wear the shirt a little longer in the fall.",0
155,44,Amazing.,"I had my eyes on this top ever since i saw it online. i couldn't be happier with it. it is very comfortable, flattering and unique. i think it will wear well into the fall with black skinnies.",2
155,44,This shirt looks amazing,"When i first saw the bees embroidered pullover in the store, it instantly caught my attention. since it was pricey, i didn't get it. when it went on sale, it ran out in my size. so recently i was fortunate enough to get the same style embroidered birds pullover in the store for 20% off the sale price. this shirt looks so adorable on and is different than the typical sweatshirt.",0
155,45,,"I wanted to love it, but it's pretty pricey for a sweatshirt & the key hole in the back with the bright pink ribbon just looks odd. the stitching & beaded detail around the bottom hem & the cuffs is gorgeous, but the sleeves were way too long on me and just looked silly. unfortunately this will be going back.",1
155,47,Beautiful beading-too boxy,"Detailed beading was beautiful. it's too boxy, way to much fabric in the waist/bust and tight on the hips. it doesn't fall boxy/boyfriend like. the grey fabric is not soft and is lighter in color than the picture. was hoping this would be my go to sweater for warmth on casual days-bummed.",1
155,48,Poor quality,"I loved the look of this top the moment i saw it in the store, particularly the muted red color. the crochet detail is very pretty and i found the fit to be quite flattering on me. however, part of the crochet detail on the one i received has a hole that needs to be repaired. since i purchased during the sale, i'm going to try and mend myself, but this may end up having to go back. if you see this in store and find one that is not damaged, i would recommend it!",0
155,49,Love the design,"This tunic was a surprise - the navy color and the knit material and the colorful designs on the front just accentuates the tunic. however, i agree with the previous reviewer about the high slits and it's pretty wide, better if it was a 1/4 or 1/2 inch less. fits tight on the arms and shoulders but a bit loose below the bodice.

i cut the tags to wear it and found out that part of the embroidery on one of the designs had unraveled!

156,45,"Ok, lightweight jean","I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body, straight up and down, i ordered 2 sizes down, but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter, not blue, and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair, but, for me, because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.",0
156,54,Tts but really long!,"Love these pants. love the fit. i can't wait to wear them, but i have to find the time to hem them first. i am kinda tall at 5'9"" and i wear a lot of heels, even tall heels. but these pants are even too long for my 3-4"" heels, and i don't wear taller than that to work every day. only on very rare occasions. so they do need to be hemmed. they are a great cream white color so can carry on through the winter and will also get a lot of use in the spring and summer. good fabric and a nice fit!",0

157,33,Waist falls down!,"I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so, of course, back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.",5
157,65,"Stylish, warm, comfy . . . but, oops!","I love these leggings - they look and feel great, but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband, so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out, for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style, comfort, and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.",1
158,22,First time purchase of pilcro!,"Earlier this year i bought a pair of pilcro hyphen's as a birthday gift for a family member, and she absolutely loved them! after hearing from her how comfortable and amazing the pants are, i had to get some for myself! i usually only wear denim pants, everything else is skirts, dresses or shorts. so this was a big change in style for me.so far i love them, they are way more comfy than i had expected and made from great material!

158,46,You will not be disappointed.,I cannot say enough about these chinos. i hope retailer will keep them around for a long time despite the news that says retailer is going the way of jcrew. these pants are more stylish and comfortable than any other chinos i have owned. i am a teacher and being comfortable and stylish at the same time is important. i am a 10 to 12 and a 30 fits me fine. please please retailer keep making these every season in fun colors!!!,2

158,54,Most stylish chinos around,"I bought these in pink and added taupe to my wardrobe because one pair is not enough. i found a tiny variation in size between my two pairs, but for the most part they are true to size. i love the just below the navel rise. they pair well with strappy or fringe sandals. i haven't worn them with boots yet, however i think they'll be great since they hug in close to the calf and ankle without being tight. buy them in the size you buy jeans or one waist size smaller if you're sometimes this or some",1

163,43,"Great jeans, but long","I'm a big ag fan, so i was excited to receive these for my birthday. i really love everything about them, but boy were they long!! even with a 3 inch heeled boot i was stepping on the hem. i'm 5'7"", so i don't often have to get things hemmed, but that was a must with these jeans. i recommend these jeans, but unless you're 6 foot tall, plan on running them to the tailors.",1

163,43,These jeans rock!,"These ultra-slimming jeans are so comfy. the rise is a little higher than i am used to but it covers those little muffin tops perfectly. the color is very dark - almost black which adds to the slimming effect. i have really long legs and these have a little extra at the bottom, which is great. you could wear with flats, booties, boots - just about any type of shoes. these are my new favorite jeans.",0

163,45,Fabulous fit; distressing will get more pronounced,"I have loved ag stevie ankle denim for awhile now and have never been disappointed with the fit or quality. this pair is no exception to that. i am 5'5"" and about 113, slender with athletic thighs and the 26 fit great. buying them on-line, i wasn't able to check how distressed the denim was. the pair i received in the mail was indeed slightly different in the distressed locations from the on-line image. mine had no distressing on the upper thigh and one medium and one small spot on each leg. onl",2
163,45,Great fit but not for a 45 year old,Loved the fit of these jeans and the fading but the ripping was too much for me at my age. i normally wear petite but since these are mid rise ankle just ordered in 27 regular. so the ripping was right at my knee and did not like that.,0
163,45,Love these,"I've never spent this much on a pair of jeans, but per another customer review that they were ""worth every penny"" i took the plunge. so glad i did. and also glad i sized down one size. be careful when you put them on - i keep putting my toe through the hole at the knee!",0

163,45,"Love, love these jeans",I love ag stevie jeans but these are my favorite. super soft with just the right amount of stretch. they keep their fit and don't stretch out. the very dark wash makes them extremely flattering. i'm petite and a bit curvy and these are extremely comfortable.,1
163,45,My favorite jeans,"These are my favorite jeans. the fabric is soft but has a good amount of weight to them. all the details reflect a high quality jean. i usually have a very hard time finding jeans that fit my backside and thighs well without a huge gap at the waist. these sit lower on my hips, no gap, and plenty of space for my butt. they do run a bit large though. i have a 29"" natural waist and think a 28 would have been even more perfect.",0
163,46,Flattering and comfortable,"Love these sateen jeans. they are a bit more polished than regular, flat black jeans, but not too shiny. i am 5'9"" and always wear a 27 in ag jeans and these were consistent with my usual size and fit perfectly. the mid-rise is very comfortable and the length on me is about the same as on the model (hits above my ankles). they're easy to dress up or down, and i have a feeling i'll be getting a lot of use out of them.",2
163,46,Great fit,"Love these jeans, fit and style... the wash is a makes them almost more navy blue than blue jean color... but they are soft and fit perfectly. another reviewer described them as mid rise, but they don't fit me that way at all",0

163,48,Love ag jeans,Love love these jeans. they are just the right rise and the straight leg is perfect. the color of the demin is great to wear to work. the fit is great.,1
163,48,Love these jeans!,"These jeans not only fit well, i love the way the fabric feels. for denim the fabric feels soft on the skin. i am 5'8 and the inseam of 30 inches was perfect. they call them ""hi-rise"", but them seem more like a ""mid-rise"" to me which i prefer. i am going to buy another pair in a different wash.",0
163,48,These are a hit!,"I am a big fan of ag, i'm sure i have 15-20 pairs. i will say that i have rejected some of their offerings in the past because the fabric has been weird: denim that is so stretchy it doesn't look like real denim, fabric is so thin it shows every lump or bump etc.. so i'm always cautious, especially with their stretch twill. that aside, these particular jeans in this gray color are awesome. ag nailed it: great color, supportive, slimming fabric, great length and rise. a job well done ag!

164,31,So silky soft,"An impulse try on that was immediately moved into the ""yes i'm buying right now"" pile. the tunic is so soft. i have worn as a shirt dress with booties and knee boots/knee socks. the fabric (while not the most forgiving if you buy this tight) is so soft and cozy. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the small hands nice and loose all around the body. when this goes on sale, i am buying more colors.",8
164,32,"Amazing product fit, black color looks faded","I tried this product in store in red and fell in love with the fit, it fits in the most beautiful flattering way, red looked gorgeous - rich glossy fabric, this could easily be one of those effortless summer transition pieces that can go from a day dress into incredible sexy night outfit. the fabric was very lush and had this rich gloss to it, i have never seen a fabric like that, it almost looked coated. red being such a statement piece was a bit too much for me, so i decided to order the produ",0
164,32,Cute and easy piece to wear,Wish this worked for me! i am 5'9''. it is much shorter than it looks in the photo and the pockets did not hit my hips or torso in the right spot. the neck was kind of tight on me too. i love the idea of this dress but need it longer. the dress is very roomy overall.,0
164,32,Cute basic  --- found it to be tts!,"As you can tell from the pictures, it's nothing fancy; i think this dress will get a lot of wear for everyday living. simple and comfy. reviewers said it ran pretty small so i sized up but wished i hadn't. it is not very ""fit",0
164,32,Great purchase,"The material on this dress is so soft and wonderfully drapey. super flattering; defines waist enough to not add bulk but also hide a tummy. the purple color is lovely, perfect for fall. for reference, i'm 5'1, 32dd, 118 lbs with hourglass figure.",1
164,32,Love!,I have this dress in red and black and i'm contemplating getting the green one. it's amazingly soft and falls beautifully. really flattering and i just had a baby 6 weeks ago! it's true to size. i'm 5'6 and 138lbs and got a small. it should still fit fine once the rest of the baby weight is gone.,0

164,32,Pretty but don't like this fabric,,3
164,32,So soft,"I absolutely love this dress. it is super soft and flattering for my body type (petite and curvy). though, i wish it did come in petite, as the upper body part of the dress would fit a little better. but that didn't stop me from purchasing as that's an easy alteration. very flattering. love it.",10
164,33,Amazing fit!!!,I never write reviews and i do a ton of online shopping but i had to write how amazing this dress is. so happy with this purchase. totally worth every penny! it fits like a dream- the rouching on the side is so pretty and i love the full coverage at the top. such he pretty colors too. perfect dress!!!,1
164,33,Comfy dress with plenty of compliments,"I am 5'4"", 145 pounds, 34dd and ended up with the size small for reference. it fit well but definitely roomy - in case you're not into that style. never tried the extra small, but i would prefer this dress not to hug onto me so i stayed with the small. 

this dress was really nice and comfy, soft material. the pockets are low and my phone stayed in while i walked but i wouldn't recommend anything heavier than a phone to go in the pockets. 

i wore this to a family and friends function and re",0
164,33,Cute dress,"I found this at my local store on sale and immediately snatched it up. i did not think of the wrap flying open until i got home and tried it on again. luckily, i was able to sew it up enough without compromising the drape and movement of the dress and without causing anyou pulling or puckering which isn't always easy when working with jersey.

that said, i really like the dress otherwise. it's super soft and i think i'll get a lot of wear out of it when i want something cute and comfy to put on.",0
164,33,Great for shorter clients,"I love this dress, but it is too short to keep. i am 5'8"" and weigh 124lbs. most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small, but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer. it looks adorable on, but it is just too short (about 3 inches above my knees) to be considered professional enough to wear to work.",0
164,33,Great quality,,0
164,33,Nice dress but,Lovely dress and looks great on me but with just my second time wearing this dress and reaching across my desk to pick something up i feel the elastic waistband snap. this dress is definitely my size and i have felt no tightness or discomfort in the midsection. i have bought cheaper clothes with better elastic waistbands and had them for years. now i will spend the rest of my day looking like i'm wearing an orange sack. i'm not pleased.,1
164,33,Not what i expected,"It was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height. the pull-on styling is a #fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening! i was afraid it might rip a seam. the fabric seems low quality, like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others. overall, not the dress or quality i expected :/",1

164,33,,"Beautiful dress, but it just didn't look that flattering on me. the quality was nice and it looked just like the picture. unfortunately it just looked shapeless on me so i had to return it. the dress is probably more flattering if you have long legs to show off, i definitely don't!",5
164,33,,"I love this dress. as a taller, long-torsoed woman, the sleeves are long enough and the length is perfect. the overall fit is also quite flattering, but i can imagine it might not be if you're shorter.

a great work-to-evening option, as well!",10

164,34,"Nice dress, fit is ok","I love the style of this dress and the color is beautiful and very much like the photo. like previous reviewers mentioned, the top is a little loose in comparison to the bottom. i originally bought a size 4 but then exchanged it for a 2. i tend to be between those sizes. the 2 fits great on bottom but the straps are a bit loose. it might be better for bigger busted ladies!",0
164,34,"Nice, but not for me","This is a very nice dress. the jersey is soft and high quality. the construction appears solid. the color is very pretty, and looks in real life just like it does on my computer. the cut and draping just don't work for me. there's just too much draping, too much fabric. it overwhelmed me and made me look bigger than i am. i have a feeling this would be much more flattering on a curvier figure than my own. this dress seemed to be trying to accentuate curves i don't really have (especially in the",4

164,35,Flattering,"Just tried this dress on in the store and ordered a petite because i'm 5'. if you are even 5'2"" or taller i wouldn't recommend a petite fit unless you prefer the tunic length. this dress and material has a flattering drape for those of us with trouble belly regions.",0

164,35,Lovely dress,"This dress is quite lovely, but there are a few things to know:

the blue color is much more of a dark teal, with more of a dull green tinge than i expected. still pretty, but definitely not a pure blue. i loved the look of the blue online, but i think the pink might have worked a little better with my coloring.

164,35,Perfect everyday dress,"I agree with one of the reviewers that the armholes on this dress are big; however, the garment is tight around my chest area (even though i am not chesty) and lays next to my body perfectly so this is not problematic. i don't feel like they are gaping holes, there is just more area there than i would be used to. i like the fabric this is made out of. it is not quite as soft as i had hoped, but it is comfortable. i would say it is a medium weight-a little more than i was expecting. the flare is",3
164,35,Perfect summer dress,"This dress is perfect for the summer, very lightweight, has pockets and not to short lounging around. it is loose fitting, so i normally wear a size 10 or m and 5'6"" tall, but had to order this dress in a s. the small fits me perfectly.",0
164,35,So flattering,I am in between sizes (and styles) after having a baby. this dress looks great on my curvy figure and enhances my look with the cinching of the belt and the detail of the flutter sleeves. perfect length and really fits well. i am very happy with it!,0
164,35,"Wasn't for me, but was soft","I tried this on today because when i touched it, it was irresistibly soft. i like the orange, it was a loud orange-and i almost would have preferred some sort of design to it. i did not purchase this because at the end of the day it did not suit my style-it was very plain. i think you could dress it up with the addition of a belt or the right necklace, but i am not usually a fan of buying pieces that do not stand on their own and require an accessory. that said, it was very comfortable and soft",2

164,39,Trying to like it,"This is a busy dress that makes me think ""boho-glam holly hobby"". i bought my usual size and it looks like nightmare of a nightgown on me. i'm going to try a size smaller in the hopes i will love it more. i'm recommending this dress for those that like the quirky whimsical hippie eclectic crafty style.",1
164,39,Unforgetable dress,"I saw this dress couple weeks ago and i really liked its color. the dress was ok untill i wore it. well. it's one of those dresses which are not great on hanger but great on you. well, the color is awesome, matches with other bright colors, mustard yellow, wine or black. the material is very thin so if you put size down it will fit but make sure that you see yourself in the mirror and see your back; i saw many ladies which put the dress which fits them but it does not fit the way it supposed to",0
164,39,Would have loved in summer,"I had this in my wish list a long time, ten when sale came along, my size was sold out. however, someone returned it at my local store. i purchased it then tried it on later... why i ended returning it:

fabric was gorgeous, and light, but fall is coming, and i won't wear it until next summer. may get over it by then
the shape is really nice, but the hem hit me in a weird spot on my short muscular legs
as others mentioned, there are spots where the sewing is not ""perfect"" and bulges a little",0
164,39,Yep!,"Pretty much awesome... i tried it on in regualr size jsut to see, and i could almost get away with it... too bad i dind't try it on before hte 25% of f dresses... (also, i don't have an occasion to wear this).

length is midi, but since it is gathered, i could pull it up a little so it falls in the right spot on me.

color is very nice, overall sexy dress.

material is soft and comfortable, nothing wrong except i missed out on the sale! :-)",1

164,40,Cheap material -- poorly made,"Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven ""hump"" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality.",48
164,40,Comfortable and chic,"This dress is so comfortable, and i love the unique faux leather skirt and lace design. it really adds a special touch to the dress. i only gave it four stars because the top half is pretty boring...i wish the neckline wasn't so matronly. i'll definitely need a bib necklace or scarf to dress it up. i'm 5'5"" and 115 and ordered the xs. i wish the dress cut in a little more at the sides to accentuate an hourglass figure, also. my husband loved it.",0
164,40,Great fall piece that's comfortable!,"I saw this dress online and purchased to see how it felt on. i love the material and its quality. it did run a little big, i usually wear a medium in most retailer clothing, but sized down per other reviews. the dress is beautiful and look forward to wearing through fall and winter but just wish it tapered a little more from the waist down.",0

164,41,Disappointing,"I really liked this dress in pictures online. i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays. everything about this dress was a disappointment, especially at this price point. the fit was weird: tight in some places, too loose in others (i'm usually xs or s, i ordered this one is s). it's made out of a fairly thick and warm material, yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures, especially in the back, making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck, upper b",3
164,41,Love it,Love this dress. sooo comfortable and flattering. i typically wear a 4-6 in dresses or can be between small and medium depending on style and cut. i went with xs on this dress and it's still very comfortable and loose fitting. the small size fit fine but seemed like too much fabric on the skirt.,0
164,41,Love this dress,"I've had my eye on this dress ever since i saw it in a fall catalog. my daughter's name is tegan and this is exactly the style i love - simple. when it went on sale i was lucky enough to find it in the green color i wanted at a great price. it is so soft and comfortable, yet flattering. it's a must have. now i want to get this in black!",0
164,41,"Pretty, airy dress","I tried the pink color on in the fall and liked it but wasn't sure how much i'd wear it for the price. i ordered down a size in the maize for the holidays when it went on sale. i think i prefered the subtlety of the pink/blush color. the maize is a goldenrod yellow, not as light a shade as it looks in the online picture. i'll still keep it because it is super comfy, though the sequins don't show as well as on the blush. it will look cute with leggings and boots or high heels. i didn't find it to",0

164,41,Undecided on this one,"I thought this was love at first sight. the color and design are both stunning. and it drapes just perfectly over the body without looking like a tent. and the fabric feels nice, but the very first time i put it on, it snagged on my fingernail (and my nails are kept short and neat). this wouldn't have been a problem, except that the snag is very obvious. this material seems like it's going to snag on every single thing. i didn't dare even try on a necklace for this reason. i'm really undecided o",5
164,41,,I ordered this dress on a whim because of the 20% off on mother's day weekend and i am so glad i did. this dress is very flattering. i have a hard time finding dresses that are a little loose but don't make me look fat. this dress has just the right cut. i recommend it for anyone who likes something not to tight but also flattering.,15
164,42,Artsy,"I saw this in the store and it caught my eye right away due to its bold color and pattern. i tried on an extra small and it was large, especially in the sleeves. i ordered an extra small in petite and it fits perfectly. i love the velvet and jeweled detail along with the cris cross tie. i wore it to work today and received so many compliments. one lady said how artsy i looked. i paired it with burgundy velvet tie up boots to complete the look. totally worth the money ladies!!",1

164,42,"Beautiful dress, fits poorly","I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3"", but it fe",5
164,42,"Cute style, terrible material","Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute, the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice, heavy knit-like material, but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back.",20
164,42,Different dresses,"I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.",4
164,42,Easy to wear,"Very comfortable dress and cool for our hot summers. i ordered in my normal size medium. neckline is cut a little low, but not enough to change my mind on the purchase.",1
164,42,Nice dress for work or a date,"Bought this dress based on the other reviews and was glad i did. fabric is very nice and soft. it drapes nicely, hiding my tummy trouble area. very flattering and not too short, i could wear it with a blazer to work and also out on a date night. happy with my purchase.",0
164,42,Unique dress,I like how this dress is really different and fun with the slit up the front and the short layer revealed underneath. it can be worn in many seasons. i wore it yesterday with sandals but i could also see wearing it with booties and a cardigan. cute dress!,0
164,42,,"I bought this item in green and then ordered it in red. very comfortable fabric and flattering by itself or over leggings. these tunics will be staple in my closet. i normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but i ordered a small to have it a bit more fitted instead of baggy. good decision!",0
164,43,"Beautiful flowy, dreamy dress","This is the second dress i buy at retailer this year and this one is spot on!! exactly what i was looking for: feminine, dressy yet can be dressed up or down depending on the circumstance. the fabric in this dress is particularly gorgeous, very comfortable on the skin, very flowy so it doesn't have a ""heavy"" quality to it and the design is amazing with the navy ribbon on the front. i completely fell in love with this dress! this is a little number to keep for many years.",0
164,43,Cute with boots and tights for winter,"This is definitely one that looks better on than on the hanger. i am 5'10"" so it is a little too short for me to wear with bare legs (it tends to ride up) but it looks great with boots and tights. i love the raw edges of the striped a-line part. i have also worn it belted and that is also a very cute look.",0
164,43,Fun breeze,"The great thing about a swing dress is that it doesn't cling to the curves. this one is the same way. i got the geometric print. the colors are fun. i would have gone down to the small just to loose some of the material on this dress if it had not fit across so tight across the back. if you have no bust, i would say size down two sizes or try a petite. the dress has a breathable fabric so great for summer wear. the only cons are the large armpits and extra fabric but sizing down should help.",3
164,43,"Great design, poor execution","I was really excited about this dress. i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece, casual or dress up. when it arrived in the mail, the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress. unfortunately it hung like that, too. the material sags in places it shouldn't. i have a 5'8"" 125 lb frame, and i ordered an extra small, and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back",0

164,43,,"I loved this dress when it came out last spring in gray. this year, i got the red and sand color. it wears so easy and can be dressy or casual- depends on how you want to wear it. i would say each color fits differently, try them on. the dress is worth the price.",1
164,44,Jewel tone gorgeous,"The fabric is breathtaking, both the jewel tone colors and the burnt velvet that would flatter any skin tone. as usual, eva franco clothes run small so i went up a size, size regular 6 (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) fit well, the hem is below my knees, appropriate for work. but i think it would look better as a skirt or a sheath dress. the top part looks strange, does not enhance any curve and turns the dress to frumpy on short folks like me, thus one star off.",0
164,44,"Loved it so much, i bought two!","Love this dress so much! i bought the cranberry color first, and i loved it so much, that i also bought it in black. i think it runs fairly true to size. i am 5'3"" and about 110, and the xs petite fit perfectly. i tried the xs, and it was pretty large on my frame. i love the fabric and flow of this dress, and i love the pockets.",0

164,44,Simply perfect!,This rich color is so flattering!  i also love that it has pockets and can be worn to dressy events or can be worn in more casual settings.  the side stripes give it a young and interesting touch.  the elastic waste makes it comfortable so i know i will get lots of use out of this.  i knocked off one star because of the price.  i plan on paring this with tan sandals and a dark denim blazer to start off with.,0

165,34,Ideal fit and feel for gals with curves,"With my 5'9', hourglass frame, wider hips and having a baby, i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however, with this, i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts:

pros:
- lots of stretch and comfort.
- pockets! always a plus in my book :)
- will go with any top.

165,34,"Nice color, love the snap buttons",This skirt is a great length and nice piece for fall/winter. i love the color. it fits like a high waisted skirt would which is why i purchased the next size up.,0
165,34,Wonderful but going back,"This skirt is beautiful (especially the color) and looks well made. however, i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me. i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasn't flattering. i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this.",5
165,35,Sizing differrent from other current pilcro skirts,,2
165,35,Unexpected color,"First of all, the one that looks white is actually a powder blue color. this isn't necessarily bad, but i would have really liked a white one and i was disappointed when it arrived blue. i should have looked more closely at the picture and paid attention to the very unreliable color button on the website.

at any rate, i like this skirt a lot as a causal everyday piece of clothing. in the summers, i tend to wear skirts rather than shorts and am always on the lookout for something that is not t",4
165,35,,"After promising myself never to buy another a-line skirt that makes me look shorter, i caved in because this one is so cute. the material is soft but holds its shape. you do have to have a long narrow waist line to pull this one off and size up one as i'm usually a 2, but took a 4 in this beauty. vintage perfection. pair with turtleneck or form fitting sweater or tee and clogs or heeled tall boots. it's a must!",18
165,35,,"Great versatile skirt, very flattering",0
165,35,,This skirt makes me look at least a size smaller. i love it! the sa was wearing it in the store and it liked great on her as well with just a plain white top. tts- got my usual 10 in green.,1
165,36,Perfect!,,3
165,38,Fun skirt with a little twist,"I bought this skirt for an end of summer ""caribbean"" party. the floral detail is even more fun in person. it looks great with a red top or black tank.",0
165,38,Great fit for curves,"This skirt fits my curves so well. the adjustable waist is so helpful for getting the perfect fit. it sits high on me, but i have a very long torso so that didn't bother me and actually made the length more flattering for my shorter legs. the colors are vibrant and versatile.",1
165,38,I wish it were more flattering,"Really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece. unfortunately because i have ample hips, the skirt just made me look very wide overall. in addition, i am short at 5'2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter.",4
165,38,Recommend with reservations,"This a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure. this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure - small waist, feminine hips.",1
165,38,,"This skirt was cute on, but not particularly flattering. i thought the denim was a little too stiff. typically, a-lines are flattering on my figure, but this was a miss.",0
165,39,"Beautiful, unique piece","Love it! i am 125# and usually a size 2-4 or 26-27 in bottoms. typically size up for holding horses. based on other reviews, i ordered this in a 2. it stretched just a bit after wearing all day, so i'm glad i didn't get my normal 4. the fit is great, quality is great. it dresses up for a casual office day, wearing well with boots and tights, and i imagine pairing with tshirt and flip flops over the summer. i unique piece that quickly became a favorite.",0
165,39,Feminine,"I love the feminine feel and look of this skirt. it is unique and matches many different shirts and looks great with a jacket. the only thing is it does run large. i ordered a 6 (my usual size) and it is very loose, not form fitting like the photo, but still cute and wearable. downsizing would've been better.",8
165,39,Great skirt,This skirt is adorable. there is no give to it though. i usually wear a 4/6 and got the 4 and i can't gain a pound or it won't zip. it is perfect for spring and summer. i'm 5'8 135.,0
165,39,Love love this skirt!!,This skirt is gorgeous!! drapes beautifully & the color is vibrant! get it!! you'll be so pleased! i sure am!!!,1
165,39,"Lovely summer print, runs small","This is a beautiful skirt; the colors are fresh and summery, yet subtle, and it's a nice sturdy cotton, not flimsy and cheap looking. however, i agree with the reviewer who said that this runs small. i take a 4 in most skirts, but i had to try on a 6 and still felt that it didn't fit quite right. if you're extremely thin, this might be great for you.",0
165,39,Small,"Tried this on in store and it runs very small. i am a size 4, but have curvy hips, so i sized up to a size 6 and i couldn't even button it. i was hoping it was more of an a-line, but it's fit more like a pencil skirt. not very flattering on my body type. overall, cute design, but not for me.",2
165,40,Cute and comfy skirt,This skirt is really cute and very comfortable. i can dress it up for work or dress it down for casual. fun color too.,0
165,40,Just okay,"The skirt is not as form fitting as i had hoped. it is a lot of material that is flowy and billowy, not straight and pencil-like as shown as in the pictures. the material and design is just okay- not super wowed by it. i did size down but feel like i might need to size down even more to get more of a fitted look.",0
165,40,Love it!,It's a beautiful skirt. the color is vivid and the skirt is flattering.,2
165,41,Cute!,"The is such a cute a-line skirt and perfect for the summer with a white tee. i bought the moss color and the rose gold buttons on it look really pretty. i'm 5'1 ,103 pounds and bought the 00 regular since i did not want to go too short with the petite size. it does run slightly big so order a size down if you have a smaller waist. love this and the price!",6
165,41,Overall a nice purchase,The skirt is so cute but it runs pretty small.  the fabric is nice and heavy it is adorable with a chambray top.,0
165,42,So cute!,This skirt is so cute. this is a staple to have in your wardrobe. i wear it with boots and boot socks. but tights for cold winter days as well as flip flops in the summer. i got my true size of 4. its fits perfectly. i love the length with a peek of leg when you walk!,4
165,42,Sweet summer patterns,"Love the pattern play on this skirt! i had to size up to a 6 (i usually take a 2 or 4 in skirts) as it was too snug in the hips/waist. going up a size worked well and the hem hit me at the knee (i'm 5' 6""). thought it looked cute with the cloth & stone chambray tank :)",3
165,43,Cutest skirt ever!,The fit on this skirt is flawless. i usually need alterations at the waist but this one was perfect for me. the buttons are so adorable and the color (orange) is vibrant and perfect for spring and summer. will wear this a lot!,0
165,44,Simply sweet skirt,"I was so surprised to find this in the sale. it is beautiful. light and airy while lined. the color is bright and fun. it is so comfortable. i ordered an xs based on reviews (this is my typical size in this type of style) and it fit great. i ordered the regular length even though i am only 5'4"". i am about 120#. will be an easy ""go to"" skirt to throw on for a casual look or can be dressed up. did i mention comfortable?",0
165,44,Skirt dimensions are off,,1
165,45,,Love this skirt length and the detail buttons. also great give to the jean fabric. looks great on and runs true to size.,0
165,46,Dress up or down,I love how you can wear this with a t-shirt or blouse.,0
165,46,This product has a slim fit.,This skirt is a great fit for curvy women. i highly recommend it.,16
165,47,"Versatile, great fit, pockets!","It's rare to find such a great skirt -- flattering, unique design, substantial (denim-like) fabric, something with pockets! this skirt has everything, including an adjustable buckled waist. i love the slight a-line shape, too. for me it fits true to size (the same size i wear in skirts from other brands). i love the colors -- ivory background, cobalt, periwinkle, orange, blush pink, yellow, black. it will be easy to pair with tees or button-down shirts and cute sandals.",0
165,48,Cute unique skirt,"I loved the multi stripe pattern, buttons, pockets and a-line shape .  i agree it runs small. i sized up from my normal size 4 to size 6.  it sits at my belly button which i like.  i can tuck in a thin shirt comfortably.  the pockets kind of sag/pooch forward and don't lie straight through the course of the day but not enough to really bother me.  i  straighten the skirt by pulling up.  great buy on sale. i'm 5'2"", 115#.",0
165,48,Good skirt,"This is a good skirt, although i think the fabric keeps it from being great. it fits well, has a good shape, and drapes nicely. the synthetic material is ok, and i'll keep it, but it may limit the use. i'll wear it to work, but probably not to nicer events.",0
165,48,Small waist but nice,This brand generally runs small but really this skirt is exceptionally small in the waist. i usually take an 8/10 in retailer bottoms and i had to go up to a 12! i love the details and uniqueness of the skirt. i like the shape and very much my style in a skirt. fabric is soft . i waited for sale plus promo and it was then worth the purchase. it reminds me of an old school retailer style .,2
165,48,"So flattering, not too short","I'm 5'7"", 120 lbs, size 0 was best.  ordered the green color.  great flattering fit!",0
165,48,,"I just recently purchased this skirt and i love it!
it's cotton with spandex incorporated, so it's soft and not stiff. it hugs your waist and accentuates your butt nicely. the lace up is unique in design, so it can be dressed up with a sparkle blouse or dressed casual in a t-shirt. i'm 5' 1"" in height so the length is very flattering and it zips up in the back. great color cream and excellent quality.",3
165,49,Poor quality,"This skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great. i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it. however, on the third wear, the side zipper split wide open. needless to say, it was returned.",0
165,50,Great design and fabric,"This skirt is so light and breezy perfect for hot or humid weather. the first time i wore it i got compliments all day long. the length is perfect for a more conservative look, i don't wear mini skirts and the slit on the side shows just the right amount of leg. it runs a bit large so i had to go down a size.",7
165,50,Lining too short,I had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven. its shorter in the back and falls weird. i love the color even better than the picture. but quality is lacking for this high price. i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too. bummer,1
165,50,Perfect skirt,"Thank you pilcro for making a skirt that is a great alternative to shorts or capris. i bought the green skirt and wore it on vacation. i realized a lighter color would be nice for summer, and ordered the light blue. it's tempting to get the red as well. the fit is great. i am 5'7 and the length is perfect. the skirt has weight. i am sure i will wear both of my skirts time and time again.",1
165,51,Lovely skirt,"I bought the skirt in green in size 6 (i am 5'4"" and 143 lbs). it fit very well and was very flattering and the length was perfect. i can see myself wearing it a lot this spring and in summer.",1
165,51,"Pretty, but going back","I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.",9
165,52,Beautiful and comfortable skirt,"This is a lovely, romantic skirt that hangs nicely. it is lined except for the ruffle on the bottom. as others have said, the waistband is stretchy and molds to your shape. it is high waisted. i called the store to hold a size 4 and 6 for me to try. when i got there, i finally settled on a size 2, so it runs a bit large. i have a 25 inch waist and 36 inch hips. if this fits your style, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",3
165,52,Nice summer skirt that can be dressed up or down,"I just bought this skirt in the store and i'm happy with it, it can be dressed up or down it is made of washable silk so it doesn't require dry cleaning (but it should be hand washed or on delicate cycle obviously). it fits through the hips without being overly clingy. the waist is a wide stretchy smocking style so there is some give.",16
165,52,Perfect skirt,Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too.,1
165,53,Cute,"I am not particularly fond of this skirt - it is good quality and nice color but i expected material to be little bit more substantial, it is too ""limp"" for my taste, but if you prefer very soft and ""worn in"" feeling, it might work great for you. also, i prefer wearing my ts over the skirt (not inside) and since waistband is very elaborate and is followed with thick buttons right below, it just looks funny under thin summer t-shirts : /. overall, just not working for me, but skirt is cute and tr",1
165,53,Pretty and feminine but...,"Lightweight, airy silk. it's not shown in the photos but it has a half slip which is too noticeable through the thin silk. it looks somewhat cheap. the silk doesn't feel smooth to the touch. it has a slight roughness to it. it would have been nicer if they had used thicker, higher quality silk. the waist has a tight, wide, elastic band which after wearing for awhile feels uncomfortable. the color of the skirt is true to the photos. i wanted to love this skirt but i will be returning it.",0
165,54,,So small! i was a solid size 12 in skirts but recently lost some weight. i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 12 thinking i can always take it in if i have to. the 12 - which should have been big on me was tiny. this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips. returning.,5
165,55,Love this skirt,"I read all the reviews and they were very helpful the waist does run small so i sized up which was perfect. i love how this skirt is lightweight and swingy. i cant get enough comfortable denim skirts. so size up and you will love this, i am a slightly hippy girl and the skirt did not make me look big at all.",1
165,56,Fits like a glove,"This skirt is a rare find. slimming, flowing, and best of all, it finally sits on my waist and not on my hips, while hugging the hips in all the right places for the streamlined and sexy look. the fabric is substantial, yet soft, so no weird sticking out sides. the color is delicious very pale-tea-rose, better in person that the picture here, and is fresh for summer. nice length for office. easy to pair with either fitting or loose top/s and jackets. i also got a distressed denim pilcro west to",5
165,56,,"I think i wanted a skirt like this in the 1980s. with its aged denim and retro style, it looks like i've had it all that time. i couldn't zip my usual 4 but the 6 is comfortable if a bit snug, sitting right at my natural waist. it's flattering and shows off my waist with tops tucked in, something i never do with my other skirts, which all sit lower. i like how it flares a little oddly due to the horizontal seam. it's interesting and different. i will wear it in summer with sandals and it will lo",0
165,57,Cool summer skirt.,"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40. i wear a size 30 in hyphen chinos and they are loose. i could get in a size 10, but i felt the stretchiness made it look like it was pulling slightly. i decided to get the size 12 even though it was a hair loose.

2. the skirt hem is right above my knees. it's not as short as it appears on the model.

3. the back pockets are sewn shut, so they won't sag.

165,57,,The material is beautiful and as others said its a bit fuller than one might think. i am returning because it's high waisted with a thick elastic waist band. not my style - i suppose it would work with a thick belt. as i said its beautiful - just not my style.,0

165,60,Cute tensile style jean skirt,"Adorable skirt but fit is definitely too tight like the other reviews before me 
 i am super petite 4 11 105 pounds the double zero and zero were just a little tight for me and a little too long ( both could fit around my waist which is a 24 but high waisted and tight not a fit around the hips)

 great skirt in the theory  with the wrong  waste fit and length",5

165,62,Great midi denim skirt,"It is very hard to find a great midi denim skirt. pomona's is very stylish, well made, and looks great on. i had to exchange my size 10 for a size 12 and am awaiting its arrival, remaining hopeful it will provide a better fit. first time in my life i have purchased a 12 so can't say for sure whether the skirt runs small or i am now running larger. i recommend this skirt.",4
165,62,The perfect skirt,"Almost the perfect skirt! great colors,super cute fit,very flattering,great length,very versatile. only issue was size; normally a solid 10, i ended up a full 2 sizes smaller. very stretchy and comfortable,just try it on first or order a couple of sizes. go down at least 1 size. as others have said...pilcro strikes again,its such a great brand with the most flattering shapes and fabrics.",0
165,62,,"Tried this skirt on in the store and loved it...so pretty,feminine and versatile,except for the color.. although its a gorgeous color and i do love red,how often do people wear red skirts? i would have snatched it up if it were offered in other colors. unlike the other reviewer,i think the ruching is great as it gives you the option to wear the skirt higher or lower on your waist and adds the axtra interest factor. as this would be a totally frivolous buy,i'm going to resist and try to wait for",2

165,63,Perfect for everything!,"Love this skirt. super comfortable, yet nicely tailored. roomy pockets always come in handy. the dark mustard looks great with the black and white tops that dominate my closet. this will be my go-to skirt for the fall for both my business-casual office environment and weekends out and about running errands, etc. i agree with the other reviewers re: sizing: because of the stretch, if you?re between sizes, you should size down. i'm usually a medium, or size 8 or 10, so i got the 8. i may have been",0
165,67,Not as pictured!,"The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it, and was mostly white, yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.",17

166,22,Perfect for fall and cozy days,I absolutely am obsessed with this poncho! it is the perfect piece for fall and so easy to layer.,0
166,22,,"I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous, but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance,--i should have listened !",12
166,23,Amazing,I am six feet tall so this will definitely be a tunic with jeans or leggings but if you are shorter it could easily be a dress. lovely pattern with soft cozy fabric. nice weight and hangs well. definitely a keeper!,0

166,25,Absolutely amazing!!,I kept going back to this sweater as this goes with so many different bottoms! thank you retailer! i ordered the petite version since i am not as tall as the model so the length is perfect! the speckles of gray are beautiful and would frame any complexion! the fit if flattering with straight pants or short skirts.,3

166,30,Cute!!,"I am going to disagree with reviewers who say this runs small. i found it very short and wide. that being said, it is meant to be cropped. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly, albeit a little short. for reference, i am usually a size 6/medium in retailer shirts and dresses.",0
166,30,I love this!,"This poncho is my new favorite thing. the material is soft and it is long enough in the back to cover your butt which i also love so that i can wear leggings underneath. i normally wear a size m top, but bought the xs/s poncho otherwise it was just too big. the only negative is that you have to hand wash :(",1
166,30,,"Nice fabric, great color, would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves, take a pass--too much like maternity wear, and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up ""is she or isn't she"" kind of way.",0

166,32,Mixed review,"Loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on. it's a gorgeous shade of blue (denim, not navy) with some light tie-dye streaking along the top and sides which add interest. the ""bat wing"" feature is a little limiting; i won't be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me. as for the material, it's an interesting blend bc it isn't soft or rough. some may say it's itchy and some may say it's soft, to me it isn't either. it's merely smooth enough. which sounds terrible, ""it",0
166,32,Not what i expected,"Huge bummer. this top is definitely a crop/midi-top. plus, it's cream, not white like shown in the photos. i'm returning it today.",4
166,32,,"Great fabric and design, beautiful pattern with flattering angled bottom hem and fringe. so soft and comfortable.  the hood is cuter left down. perfect transitional piece for fall.  i got the neutral color and it is so easy to wear.  i'm 5'3"" and got the s/xs size and feel that it is still wearable.  i second the opinion one reviewer mentioned about wearing a belt through the slit over the front part. definitely works well and makes for an effortlessly stylish look.",0
166,32,,"This is a great piece to help ease on in to the chillier days of fall and winter. it's versatile- i can see myself wearing it with plain short or long sleeved tees or even tops with more elaborate padderns or button downs! there's so many options i cannot wait to put this gorgeous piece to use! just as an fyi, the sleeve openings are slightly unfinished and have a frayed effect to them. this may not even be noticeable if you're not looking right up close. for me, this adds to the unique quality",2
166,33,Adorbs,"Very cute, very flattering. the peplum is fairly subtle and really works, falling at just the right place for me (i'm 5'5). i got the red and have worn it over a dress and with jeans. the color is deep and works well with my pale skin. the fabric is quality and looks like it will hold up well over time - always an issue with sweaters.

166,33,No,"Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.",2
166,33,Not as pictured.,"Online, this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact, i'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately, this sweater will not work for me, as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier.",8

166,33,Strange fit,"I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring, and it seemed perfect. plus, the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed, but i'd say surprised. 

i would still consider this sweater good for spring. it's thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly, i would prefer it to be less stretchy, but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality",0
166,33,Stunning,"I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one. it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant, cool tone not orangey. i fell in love with this one in person. it jumped at me in the store, but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice. if you like to cover your assets, you will love it.",2
166,34,A+++,"I fell in love with this top in the store and ordered another online. it is very soft and comfortable. the petite tend to run a little short in the front, but the regular is perfect. it's oversized without being frumpy or boxy on my petite frame.",0
166,34,Loooooove this sweater,"I ordered both colors, but ended up keeping the green in petite xs b/c the red in xs was just slightly too big. both colors are gorgeous, and i agree they have a retro 70's vibe. just a tad itchy, but not enough that it would make an undershirt absolutely necessary. i'll probably just wear it alone. i think the regular size would work for most petites b/c it's not ridiculously long. i would suggest sizing down in regular if you're petite though: for instance, the regular xs fit noticeably larger",3
166,34,Wardrobe staple,"I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it'd work out based on all of the good reviews. when i got it, i was happy with the fit and fabric, but i was stumped as to what i'd wear it with. it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just didn't know if i could pull off the length. i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath. it's so stretchy, warm, and cozy! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k",0
166,35,Detailing is amazing,"I have tried this on several times now and have yet to pull the trigger. i like the coral color the best for its versatility. the detailing on this cardigan is fantastic. i especially like the back, the stitching is already very flattering, but then the pleats really add an extra touch. the only reason i have not bought it yet is that i wish it was slightly longer-especially with it being a cashmere piece. i am slightly worried about it shrinking in any way, which would make it much too short an",8
166,35,"Fits strange, flimsy material","I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu",0

166,36,Great piece for layering,"I like this sleeveless sweater - it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk. paired with black/white patterns it's pretty versatile (as seen in the pics) - a great staple for a more casual office environment. being a taller girl i love the length on it, and find it's flattering for my curvy figure.",0
166,36,Not worth cost,"Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap, like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it.",0
166,36,Pretty and comfy,"Last minute i needed a family-friendly top for a chilly night, so i tried on a couple of flowy sweaters at retailer and this was the keeper. while i found other styles a bit too boxy or bulky for my short torso, this has a nice a-line shape that gave me a slim profile while still being forgiving, plus the detail up top is feminine and i liked not having fabric piled up around my neck. i am usually a small but wanted this to fit like the model so i sized up to a medium and voila, i am a model. just",5

166,38,Comfortable & effortless,"This top is the bomb. the red is a perfect balance of washed out but still rich. the thin spaghetti straps and scooped back make it sexy, but it still looks effortless. perfect to pair with light weight, light wash jeans. it's also nice that it's not clingy at all, lends to the casual look. total keep for me.",0
166,38,Darling cardigan with beautiful detailing,"This cardigan is beautiful with its cropped fit, flutter sleeves and vineyard detailing. i can see wearing this a lot this fall and winter. my only complaint is that the sweater was pilling/shedding quite a bit the first time that i wore it. i hope that that doesn't happen every time that i wear it. i also have yet to wash it to see how the fabric looks after washing.",0

166,39,Very cute but kind of an odd fit,"I like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it. however, i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable. there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating. also would not recommend if you are busty. because of how the stripes run, it looks stretched out over my chest.",1

166,43,Fun holiday top,"This is a fun sparkly top that was great over the holidays with a sparkly long-sleeved top underneath, and will be fun in the summer too. i got a size small since my regular size extra-small was sold out, and it was still really cute. great cut and design. as others have mentioned, the quality could be slightly better, but it's a good deal if you get it on sale.",0

166,48,Subtle detail makes this great,I love this sweater. i bought it in black and love the way the back falls gently and flatters my figure. i'm curvy on bottom w/ a butt and tummy so i like to cover them but i don't want to look like i'm wearing a moo-moo. this top looks chic. it's the right shape to flow gently. it's just the right detail to be different in an understated way. i wear it w/ leggings and jeggings because it falls low enough to cover my butt. neckline is good-- i'm a 34b and it's flattering. not sure if it will fla,1

166,50,Favorite sweater this season,"I got this in navy and love it. the overall shape is sleek and classic - body skimming but not tight - with subtle detail in the knit design that make it entirely unique. the quality and weight of the cashmere is perfect - not to heavy or light. xs fit perfect on my 5'5"" petite frame. but busty or longer-torsoed people may find the length a bit short - it hits me right at the top of regular low-rise jeans. this may be my favorite retailer buy of the season.",11
166,50,Great as a dress,"Have had a hard time finding comfy dresses appropriate but not too long for my 15 year old daughter. purchased this tunic in a regular xs and she loves it! she wore today with suede booties-very soft, cute and longer than many dresses sold for teens. she initially thought it was a winter sweater dress but i explained it is mostly cotton and would be a great transitional piece for spring and fall.",0
166,50,Much nicer on than on the hanger!,"I liked this sweater in the picture but was less impressed when i saw it in the store. it looked a bit odd and perhaps cheap to me. still i decided to leave it on my wish list and got it as a christmas gift. once i tried it on, i really liked the way it looked and felt! it's flattering, comfortable and looks great with jeans! it's really cozy! i rated it tts but you could almost size down on it.",3
166,50,Not for me ... maybe for another,"The high neck and ""square-ness"" did not work for me .. but might for someone else.",0
166,51,Great poncho,I love this poncho because it's the perfect weight and it is softer than i thought it would be. i will get a lot of use out of it. getting it on sale made it even better.,0
166,51,Very satisfied!,I love this sweater! it does run a little large though. fits beautifully. great for cool summer nights and early fall. dress up or down.,0
166,52,Cute but large,"I tried this on in the navy/white combination and loved it, except it is cut rather full or large through the waist especially. if you can size it down so it fits you, you will love it. it is very soft; an easy top to throw on, feel comfy, and look fantastic! i sure wish it was smaller :/",1
166,52,Nice but too thin,"I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light, the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.",3
166,52,Nice sweater,"This sweater runs large and long in the arms. i am 5'5"" and often wear petite in pants but not tops. the medium petite is perfect, the sweater is a beautiful open gauge knit and will be great this fall/winter for work over a tank and nice pants. the blue color is more of a mint green/blue, very pretty and different than anything i have in my closet. great addition.",1
166,52,Perfect holiday sweater,"This sweater is so much cuter in person than as pictured. i bought the lovely red one today. i got my usual size, xs. i plan to wear it more fitted as a top rather than as a jacket, although i can still layer it if i want. the color is divine. the weight is just right, not too heavy but not too light. sometimes peplums overwhelm me, but this one did not. it hits at just the right spots and is flattering all over, particularly making my waist look small.",3
166,52,,"I love this sweater!! i like sweaters that are narrow on top and taper out so it doesn't look like a sack on me. plus, it is the perfect weight. i wish i would have bought one in a different color because it is so comfortable.",0
166,53,Great top!,Love it to layer. it is not heavy the perfect weight & soft material. my daughters all want to steal it!,0
166,53,Never met a turtleneck i didn't like...,"This is no exception to the rule! i love turtlenecks and this one is going to be a favorite. do know that this is not lightweight-even though this is sleeveless it is definitely a substantial knit. the color is a beautiful nutmeg and can be dressed up or down. i purchased a gorgeous neutral beaded necklace to go with it and it is simply stunning! it does 'bell out' a little at the bottom which, in my opinion-is the only design flaw. i normally wear a medium in most retailer tops and the small is a",0
166,53,"Nice cardigan, odd colors","I ordered this for my mom in color ""blue motif"". i could not see a difference online between the colors ""brown motif"" and ""blue motif"" - both looked grey to me. in real life blue motif looks grey with a very light bluish tinge to it. it looks like grey wool and light grey-bluish fiber was interwoven, but you have to look very closely to see that. i guess i would have prefered a pure white or cream color but that is a matter ot your pesonal taste i guess. the cardigan style is an oversized one. t",29
166,53,Perfect comfy now top!,"For a now feel, that comfy and well made, this was a great choice!",0
166,54,A great top with nice detail!,"The lace inlet sleeves on this comfy top add unexpected detail that dresses it up. you can wear this with jeans or skinny cords, as well as a fitted skirt. the material is comfy and the neck is not too tight, nor too loose.
i usually wear a small and the small fit the best. i tried the xs and medium and although they both fit, the xs seemed a bit too short and the medium was too long in the arms.",0
166,54,Adorable,I love this poncho. i would wear it to the beach or even for fun outing like wine tasting!,0
166,54,Boxy,"I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on, it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it, but i knew i would not wear it so, unfortunately, it went back.",0
166,54,Comfort & style,"I have already worn this several times. it is very flattering, lightweight, and easy to wear. dressy but also very soft and comfortable.",0
166,54,Cute cute,Beautiful sweater. i first bought it in black and loved it so much i bought it in burgundy. the burgundy one is longer and slightly bigger than the black one and they are both smalls. nice thing is i can wear the burgundy one with leggings. love the lace on the sleeves and the sweater is a nice weight.,0
166,54,Keeper,"Wasn't expecting this to look good on when i grabbed it off the sale rack. to my surprise it's very cute. the very high up slits for the 2 front panels and the lightweight knit break up the heavy appearance of this poncho when it's on. you can slip your arms out of the sleeves to keep warm when the evening gets cooler. i love it. got the gray and black stripes on off white background. will try belting the two front panels, as another reviewer suggested. i'm 5'3"" petite. so, it doesn't swallow me",0
166,54,Retailer clothes,I love all my retailer clothes! it's my favorite store! i even love the displays!,0
166,56,Comfortable but stylish,Great top for the older woman who wants to be stylish but needs a little extra room. the subtle color goes with anything. i love it!!,1
166,56,Don't trust anyone,"Haha, the unifying theme in these reviews seems to be don't trust the picture! i was misled by the neckline, i thought i saw a structured kind of asian-inspired mockneck/funnel thing and instead the top has a foldover cowl which, with my full bust underneath it, refuses to pose as a mockneck for me. overall there isn't much structure here at all. but the print is beautiful and the sweater cozy without being itchy.",1
166,56,Imperial garden,"I bought this a month ago and returned it. but kept thinking about it so ordered it. it arrived on wed and i wore it on thursday as a dress with tights. i got so many compliments on it. it was perfect for the cool weather and was not too warm.

this knitter thinks the quality of the jacquard knit is excellent. yarn used is top notch.",1
166,56,Only the sleeves are pretty; the rest is terrible,"The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on, so when a free shipping offer came up, i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well, the sleeves are indeed stunning, but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain, blank, white canvas. in fact, that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t",0
166,56,Pretty and flowy,"A successful first date sweater. the cut is flowy so don't expect snug. the quality is average for retailer sweaters, i guess nothing will ever be pill-free? the detailing at the bust reveals a little of what lies beneath, which in my case was just a bra but in more conservative environs might have to be a camisole.",0

166,59,Gold thread,"This is a very pretty sweater, a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.",2
166,59,Shrunk,Love it but it shrank and that makes me so mad.,3
166,59,Try it! you'll love it!,,1
166,59,Well.....,I feel like a pessimist but then again nothings perfect. the only thing wrong with this stunning sweater is no button or snap so it just bags open. love it tho,0
166,60,Love the style,"I was very happy to receive this as a birthday gift. i usually wear an xs or s in clothes i buy from retailer. i was given this in a s, but it wasn't even close to meeting in the front, so i returned it for a m. it doesn't button anyway, but i didn't want it to look like it wouldn't meet at all. i tried on a size s sweater in this brand while i was in the store, and it fit perfectly, so this one is just running small. overall, i love the lace detail on the front and the softness of the sweater.",0
166,60,Sporty but delicate,"Great design & execution - this is essentially a striped jersey sleeveless turtleneck, made of a nice, high-quality jersey. with a delicate lightweight soft sweater attached over it. so you get this really pretty look where the jersey underlay means the sweater hangs beautifully, no clinging at all. and the sleeves are just the sheer sweater - so pretty.

i got the lavender - looks exactly like the pic. and it is true to size.",5
166,60,Warm and chic,"Very attractive and easy to wear. i wore it the night it arrived and wore it again the next night! i love the colors, the pattern and design. this is a stylish tunic sweater. the sleeves are not full length, which i prefer. the sweater is dense - the weave is tight, making the sweater quite warm, but not too warm.",0
166,61,More shimmery than pictured,Very pretty & shimmery. suitable for slightly dressier occasions. comfortable fit.,0
166,61,,Nice quality. too big for my taste. really liked the style but sleeves were very long.,0
166,62,Pretty everyday sweater,"The design on the blue sweater is actually a dark navy (not black, as i thought it was), but it still looks beautiful with black underneath. rather than jeans like it's shown, the v-neck is a nice change from other cardigans i have - looks great with a cami or another v-neck underneath it. soft, nice medium-weight and not at all itchy. happy with this as an easy everyday sweater.",0
166,63,Just couldn't get it to work,"I love this blouse on the model online. however, i couldn't get it to lay right and the material was a little scratchy for me. did not like the glittery thread.",0
166,63,Love it!,,2
166,63,Love this sweater in black,Very nicely made sweater which fits well. i bought the black with white accent and am very pleased with my purchase. the small fit me perfectly (34d) can't wait to wear it this fall!,1
166,63,Stylish little sweater,"I fell in love with this on-line and when it arrived today i think i love it even more because the white portion of this sweater is really a medium pink color which looks so chic. although i am not usually into pink, this looks so stylish with the pink instead of the white. this is a piece you might find in a vintage store in the village in nyc. can't wait for it to get chilly so i can wear it. for reference, i am 5'1, 36c chest and the small fit perfect. the quality is really high end as well.",1
166,64,Crazy!,It's really crazy how much i like this sweater. i am surprised by the weight of the sweater. it is a medium-light weight that will be appropriate year round. it fits perfectly and is very flattering open or zipped. i will wear this as a stand alone top with a tank underneath for now and in place of a spring jacket when the weather is warmer. this is a nice find.,0
166,64,Love the print & style,I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xs/s. although it's wool i didn't notice that is was itchy & usually wool bothers me. i am of small build but i did like the long & oversized look. i admit i am drawn to the print anyways. i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xs/s - it was the same. probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes. i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xs/s in a few wks since the invent,4
166,64,Pretty,"This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color, not close to red, but it will work well with black, gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this.",1
166,64,Pretty but unbalanced,"I didn't mind the ""scratchiness"" others proclaimed this garment had, but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back. looks great from the front, but uncomfortable.",1
166,64,So pretty!,"I found this pretty sweater to run true to size. i am between a size large and extra large and the large fit well. it is perfect in the shoulders and body skimming without being too flared at the hem. the lavender is a dreamy light sky blue, true to what my monitor shows. i rarely wear anything but black and gray, but i could not resist this color. the sweater is a medium weight and i anticipate wearing this at the beach with white jeans and now with pale gray narrow wool pants. i really like th",0
166,64,,Top is well made. runs large the arm holes were too big and sagged under my arms showing my bra. go a size smaller than your normal size.,0
166,65,Beautiful colors,"I bought the green motif and the colors are beautiful and look just like the picture. as others have mentioned, it does have a high slit on the side that has a tendency to separate and look bulky. i just put a couple of small hooks to keep it together. i normally would wear a medium or large, but based on other reviews, i ordered down to the small and it was perfect. since i live in the south where it can stay quite warm through fall, it will be a great transitional piece.",0

166,66,,Caught a sale in oct and purchased the gray. beautiful light gray. i am normally a med or lg and the small in this sweater was perfect. i am larger in the bust so it is not boxy on me. added a delicate pin to the shoulder and it was darling for our casual christmas dinner.,0

166,68,Perfect red cardi,"I had this on my wish list but saw it as a "" on of"" on black friday....and it just happened to be my sisz p it fit me perfect... if anything it runs a little big but it is great to layer. it can be worn sipped over a cami with lace showing .... or as a regular cardi/jacket over first layer! the detailing is loely! even tho it is 40% off today ( i got it with the 25% off store wide sale), my size sold out before this promo so i am very glad i got it when i did. just in time for all the christmas",0
166,70,Comfortable style and fit,"This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isn't bulky to wear under coats, etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.",6
166,70,Soft patterned long vest,"I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store. it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering. the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group. it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely. it is a soft, soft fabric, almost fleece-like but not plush.",1

166,75,Gorgeous sweater,"This is a very substantial, warm sweater that is so classy and super soft and just different enough. really great with neutral sweater leggings or jeans with boots. you have to wear a longer tank or tee underneath as it it split on the sides but the belt cinches the whole sweater in.",8
166,76,Belt missing,"I ordered this quite nice cardigan. i received the sweater promptly (yay fast shipping!) but never received the belt to it. i tried emailing about it, but didn't get a response. the sweater really is the softest thing ever but it will not close without the belt and trying to use a different belt just doesn't work. i hope to receive the belt soon, because i'd really like to wear this a lot this winter.",1

167,65,"Loungewear, not outdoor wear","So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about, but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer, so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days, but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti",55

168,23,Great for all seasons,"The dress looks great both in winter and summer, either paired with tights and a light jacket or on its own. it runs true to size--was able to buy it online. the fabric is great for all day wear--doesn't wrinkle too much.

the only con is that the darts over the breasts are a little pointy for my taste, but i still love the dress.",0
168,25,Awkward hem,"I tried on 4 different dresses and every one of them had a slightly different, awkward hem line. they were asymmetrical but only a tad bit so it just looked crooked. finally found one that wasn't so bad but decided not to purchase because the perfect fit for my arms was too big in the boobs. i am a curvy, athletic build, with broad shoulders and small waist, for your reference.",0
168,25,Gorgeous detail,"I fell in love with this dress as soon as i came across it online. ordered the dress in a large and it fit perfectly. i'm smaller on top and larger at the bottom (pear shaped). the dress fit well and hid all of my ""flaws"". only problem was that it wrinkled very easily and im wondering if i received a dress that was sitting around for awhile since it was covered with lint and white fuzz when i received it in the mail. other than that the design was absolutely beautiful with incredible embroidery.",0

168,35,Stunning! just buy a belt with it.,"I saw this dress in the window at the portland store, and had to try it on. i was a bit horrified at how huge it was once i got it on--sort of like wearing a tent. no shape at all. one of the awesome dressing room attendants brought me a belt, and suddenly it was the most beautiful dress i've ever had on. it's romantic, elegant, feminine... the fabric is so lovely and the flowy sleeves with the lower scooped back just look fantastic. i can't say enough about how amazing it makes me feel. i wore",3
168,35,,"I don't know how to explain, but this dress at least for me did not look like the model, first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts, for me it didn't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking... so definitely not for my type of body, i am normal height (5'5'', athletic and curvy body) but maybe for a very tall person looks good! the material is very interesting, it's so soft!",2
168,35,,"Love the way this looked online/on model. would not recommend for a shorter or curvy person such as myself. it just ended up looking like a very chic potato sack on me, and was not flattering.",0
168,36,Exactly what i thought,,0
168,36,"Short dress? long sleeves? yes, please!","I love tiny's aesthetic--sweet, feminine, yet always with a slightly sexy edge. this dress doesn't disappoint! during 90% of the year, i'm always cold. finding cute dresses with long-sleeves is almost as challenging as finding a unicorn. this dress is near casual perfection. i plan to wear it on breezy summer nights on a cruise to greece i have coming up. it would also be a perfect spring/fall dress before the seasons change or could be worn in winder with tights and a cardigan. see, near perfec",2
168,37,Cute idea horrible fit,"This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple, black, stylish.  unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off.  the upper arms, chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.",0
168,37,Not for me,I purchased this based on previous reviews. the quality of the dress and the print is excellent. the dress fit me perfect in the front however there were so much extra fabric in the back that it made me look extremely large. i understand it's a shirt dress however the back would need to be taken in like 6 inches. for someone who is looking for a more boxy full coverage dress this is more for them,2
168,38,,"The cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material, but the dress itself is extremely thin. the non-belted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress, which was enormous in my normal size.",10
168,38,,This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.,2
168,39,Another tiny success,"Tiny are experts at making busy bohemian shirtdresses that look casual but retain a feminine drape.  it skims over my trouble spots without adding bulk.  this is my fourth dress from this label and it does not disappoint.  for my frame and style i chose tts but those of slender & petite builds may want to size down.  for reference i am 5'3"" 140# 36dd.",94
168,39,Cute but wide,"I tried on the xs and the shoulder are fit, but the body seemed so wide on me, it took me over... i don't know if xxs would have worked, but it is not available (and petite either). fabric is soft enough for denim, color is nice, overall, really pretty dress, just unfortunately big.

168,39,Don't ignore this one,"When this dressed first debuted, i pretty much ignored it because i was not looking for a sleeveless maxi dress for fall. then i went on instagram and saw all the marvelous ways retailer employees were styling this. this can be worn as a long vest over jeans or a long sleeve maxi. and the rich autumn colors go well with boots and sweaters. add a wide leather belt when it's opened or closed, works great either way. when i bought my dara vegan leather moto in plum, i knew this would be an ideal pair",0

168,39,Love this dress,Cute print got lots of compliments when i wore it. lightweight. looks great with boots,1
168,39,Nice dress,For reference i am 5'3 121 lbs and i usually wear a size 6 or 8. i got a size small and it was still at bit large. my bf said it was a nice dress to wear around the house ( like a house dress). a bit pricey for that but the way it hangs it does look like a house dress or a bit like a sack. i kept it only because i was looking for casual dresses. i wore it out and got a few compliments ( prob cuz i never wear dresses). good luck.,0
168,39,Runs really small,"This dress is very small in the bust and maxi length on short people (5'3"" 36dd). i can't wear a normal bra, i have to use adhesive pasties. the fabric is very smooth, thick and satin like, but fuzzes easily. mine came with minor thread pulls and one strap was sewn on twisted. the pattern in real life is very pink as opposed to the model sample which has more blue landscape. i'd like to hem the dress but i would sacrifice pattern. still very pretty dress. be sure to size up one or two depending",0
168,39,,"Purchased this dress at the sale price, with an additional 20% off sale, not exactly sure what to expect-- the print is so different than my usual style preference. so glad i did! while the dress is way oversized (for reference, i'm 5'4, 132 lbs) ordered size sm but prob should have gone with xs) it's stylish, yet effortless. today is the first day of wear (at my office) and already received many complements.",1
168,40,Beautiful print!,"I saw this dress in the store & loved the print so much i had to try it on. i definitely do not own anything like this. i tried on a m & i agree that it runs large & on my petite hourglass frame it was a bit overwhelming. however, i was prepared for that & paired it with a brown belt & absolutely loved it. the belt made the dress a little shorter & definitely accentuated my curves in a good way. such a beautiful, casual dress that is actually comfortable. i can't wait to wear it with tights with",0
168,40,Great dress with a little help added!,"This dress is comfortable and the pattern is really nice with some good attention to detail on the lace trim and pockets. i ordered this in my usual pxs (i am 5'2""), but this definitely runs very large. it is a shirt style dress so i didn't expect it to be fitted, but off the hanger it was just too shapeless and sack-like for me. i really wanted it to work, so i took it to my tailor and she added a beautiful navy rope-like tie attached to both sides in the back of the dress. it looks amazing, an",0
168,40,I like it,Finally saw this dress online. i have to say that it looks better in person. the model might be too tall for this dress. i am 5'4''. it's right to my ankle. the color is in a nice off white. the material is a good quality. the overall cut is nice. it's a kind of classic feeling.you could wear it for a long time without going out of style.,12
168,40,,"Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesn't fall well. also, as has happened to me before, retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it. you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out.",1
168,40,,"Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.",1
168,41,Beautifully bohemian,"I just love this dress! it is so pretty and feminine and comfortable. the colors and patterns are perfect for both spring and fall and i know that this is one piece that i will get a lot of use out of. originally, i thought the cut would be a bit boxy but it is not at all. in fact, the fabric is beautiful, soft, and flowy with a lovely bohemian aesthetic. it looks great with tights, tall boots and a big floppy wool hat. any one considering this dress should defiantly try it on, as it is highly u",1
168,41,"Description way off, but beautiful dress","First of all, this dress is not cotton. it is 100% silk. it also not a pullover dress (it has a side zipper) and does not have an elastic waist like the description says. lastly, it is not by moulinette souers. i've really never seen a description so far off on one of the items pictured. nevertheless, it is a gorgeous dress. the silk is beautiful and can easily be worn for fall with a sweater or jacket. the waist is a little poofy and the chest is a bit snug. however, i was able to go down a siz",1
168,41,Strange shape,"I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing, the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also, the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss",10
168,42,"Beautiful, comfortable dress with slight fit issue","This dress does indeed run large like the other reviewers mentioned, but it also runs small in the shoulders. i'm 5'3"" and usually a size 6. the xs fit perfectly in the body, but was a little too small in the shoulders. i liked the dress enough to size up to a small to fit the shoulders, and then just had the sides taken in slightly. i did purchase this dress during the 20% off sale, so that helped justify the cost of alterations.",9

168,43,Wow...,"So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3"" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.",0
168,43,,"This is a cute casual dress. i've received many compliments and wear it a lot. i deducted one star because the dress is pilling in some places (mostly expected friction areas, but others as well). also the back of the dress started to rip at the stress points for the button up area. i mended it, but it should have been reinforced to begin with for a dress at the original price point.",0
168,44,Beautiful,I was a little skeptical about this one at first. i have a hard time with the over all styling of many maxi dresses. i liked the print and figured i would give this a whirl. it is beautiful! looks great on and i love the fabric!! so happy i picked this one up.,0
168,46,Adorable,"This multi-season dress fits beautifully, the colors are vibrant and the skirt has a nice weight, drape and swing to it. the skirt is slightly asymmetrical as some reviewers noted but it's probably not noticeable to anyone but the wearer.",0
168,46,Beautiful and different,"This dress is really pretty, but the fit is off. it is not fitted at the waist which made the back look poofy. also, the arm length is not flattering; it needs to be either longer or shorter. additionally, if one was to wear it a lot, the felting might start to fray.",12

168,47,Perfect dress,This is a great maxi dress for people that want a classic fit but nothing tight. it is figure flattering yet modest enough to wear to work. i am 5'3 (and a half!) and many maxis are so long that i must wear heels. this one is perfect length for me and can be worn with flats or heels.,0

168,52,"Green is beautiful color, fit too baggy and loose","I purchased the green dress in medium. i usually wear a medium. the fabric is pretty. shoulders fit nicely. sleeves were short in an odd length, but that is indeed pictured accurately. the body of the dress is very shapeless, billowy and wide, which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown. i considered altering the garment, by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward, but i decided to return the dress.",9

168,56,Fits the need!,"I was looking for a dress that was short sleeved but not sleeveless. this fit my needs--not too short, nice v neck (but not deep), pretty embroidery overall i like the dress. here are a couple of downsides--i wore the dress with tights--and due to the nature of the fabric (cotton) there was no 'glide' and therefore it rode up with the tights. also, it's a bit wide int he mid section. i wanted an 'easy' and not tight/form fitting dress, but this does have almost too much fabric in the mid section",1
168,56,No slip and totally sheer dress,"I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says ""viscose lining"" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all, it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us",0

168,61,Huge for petite,"When i ordered this online, i should have paid more attention to the picture. the dress comes to the knees of the 5'10"" model. i was swimming in small petite size. i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size. nope, it was ps. either the dress was mislabeled, or this is cut huge. returning. too bad because the shape and color are cute.",0

168,64,Mixed feelings....,"The fit and design are interesting. in the 00p, the fit was good though the dress was not easy to get into or out of - strategy required. the quality is fine. but the color was very ""blah,"" with too little of the bright stripes in an otherwise rather dull color scheme. that made the dress overall feel too busy and rather confused. with the lining and material weight, it would be more a cold weather item only, not an all seasonal dress.

generally, it was interesting but not a ""most come home wit",6
168,65,Elegant but relaxed,"I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it on various mother's day weekend insta posts by retailer stores. i was worried that it would not be a great cut for me, as it's pretty straight up and down, and i wasn't sure the waist would hit at the right place, because i'm super high waisted and this didn't appear to be so. in truth, it isn't, and i'll be tying the ribbon (or wearing a slim belt) at a higher point than where was originally intended. however, what struck me was the ability",13

168,70,Ethereal beauty,As other reviewers have stated it is hard to see in the photos that the dress has iridescent blue/pink/lavender sequins. i was surprised as well but in a good way. i think it has a unique look and is so pretty and romantic. its a vision of shimmer when you are walking. if you have somewhat of a bust i would size up because the triangles run a little small. other than that its a beautiful dress.,1

169,31,Sparkly & gold tones,"I didn't think from the photo online that the sweater would be quite so sparkly & gold! it has gold weaved in - so if the sparkly isn't your thing, beware. the sweater fit well although i didn't feel the neckline was quite as clean as in the photo above. also, you'd have to be careful not to snag on jewelry. it's a thin sweater material that may require a camisole underneath depending on the weather.",9
169,31,,Great long cardigan! i wear this with a simple tank,4
169,32,More structured than a cardi,"I just got this after ordering online and i was pleasantly surprised. the cardigan has the structure of a lightweight jacket, so it creates a flattering silhouette. i ordered it in a medium, and even though i'm curvy on top it fits really nicely.",0
169,32,,Kinda a boxy looking sweater. it definitely made me look really large and just couldn't see myself wearing it very often. ended up returning it.,0
169,33,Short and wide,"I was very disappointed by the fit of this top. it is quite short (especially in the back) and very wide. i did not find it flattering. on a positive note, the fabric is nice and thick - very warm layering piece for fall. for sizing reference, i'm 5'5'', 122 lbs, and took my usual size xs.",0
169,33,Wild wild west,"I really like this shirt. i fell for it after seeing it paired with grey jeans, but when i searched the entire website i couldn't find it. then a couple of days later it appeared. i was super excited and i'm glad i ordered it. i was not disappointed. the shirt is soft and long enough to cover my waist area without riding up if i bent at the waist. the colors are very vibrant and its quite stylish. i ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.",2
169,33,,,1
169,34,Meh,"It's a rather boring tank. i thought it'd be perfect under a cardigan for work, but decided against it. the fit is boxy, and does not look good on a girl with curves.",0
169,34,New favorite wardrobe staple!,"Yes, $48 may feel like a lot to pay for a tshirt, but this is one is worth it -- i can wear this with *everything*! i bought this in grey, and the quality and style are just right to pair with a high waisted skirt or black skinny pants to wear out at night, or wear with regular jeans and a cardigan during the day. one of the best retailer purchases i've made in a while!",10
169,35,Living in this!!,"This is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made! this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter. i am 5'9, a size 6/8 and the medium was perfect! buy this now!!",2
169,35,Love this shirt!,The print is even better in person! true to size. flattering fit.,0
169,36,,"Really fantastic shirt. ordered multiple colors and will keep them all. the gray especially looks a bit boring online, but is gorgeous in real life. it has different shades mixed together and is really pretty. neckline is interesting. wish the front was a tad shorter, (i'm 5'4) but don't think petite will work. really, really great shirt.",7
169,37,Closet staple,"Cute, basic top. it has really great detail at the top and it is a good length (it is not super long/too short). it does billow out a bit at the bottom, so i would size down (this is what i did after reading the previous reviews). i do not think i would have paid full price for this top, but on sale, it is a great deal and a nice addition to your wardrobe.",0
169,37,Cute but boxy,Cute top. i always get compliments when i wear it. a little boxy in style,2
169,37,Easy and comfortable,The tie jacket is an easy one to throw on for a casual look. it fits well to the body even better than pictured. very comfortable and medium weight so perfect for spring.,9
169,37,Great jacket,"This jacket has been a fun addition to my wardrobe. it has a very cute fit, and i like that it pulls in a bit at the sides to give it a form fitted look. best of all it stretches well despite the form fit; you can cross your arms or raise them up and you don't feel like your movement is restricted. i really like the soft suede-like material on the inside of the arms and the sides of the jacket. it fits true to size. can be worn casual or dressed up a bit. highly recommend!",7
169,37,Small ?,,2
169,37,So great i bought it twice!,"I absolutely adore this cardigan. it's easy, so comfortable, stylish and absolutely flattering on every shape!! what i love about it most is how long it is. i'm 5'8 and the large and xl come well below my bum. it's perfect to wear with leggings and boots when i'm having a relaxing easy day, but i can easily dress it up with denim or a dress underneath! totally versatile! i originally bought this in a large and it fit well. but then we got the xl in the store and i snagged that one too because i",20
169,38,Nice t shirt,"I bought this on sale. the cools on the bird pattern are beautiful and i liked the detail on the sleeves. a little see through, but ok with a nude bra or tank underneath.",0
169,38,Nothing special...,"This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy, so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall, this was just a miss for me.",3
169,39,Laid back and stylish,This piece is comfortable and easy to pair with leggings or denim. soft and not too heavy.,0
169,40,Great addition to wardrobe,I love this duster. it's really different and interesting. i wear it with the dress in the picture but i have the green dress.,2
169,40,Peplum,"I am short waisted and i still thought the pleats started too high on me. also, the whole thing was a little bit big. i always wear a medium, but in this top the shoulders and everything was just a bit large. since i bought it online, i couldn't size down. the fabric was a nice quality.",3
169,40,Winner!,"When i walked into my local retailer, two of the saleswomen were wearing this stunning top in totally different ways, and i knew it would be the perfect gift for my mom. unfortunately the small was sold out, but they were able to order it online and have it sent. gorgeous medium-to-lightweight fabric that looks great out or tucked in.",2
169,41,Cute but a bit too long,"I bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide. i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online. the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model. i am 5'1"" tall and weigh 110 lbs. i believe the petite would have been a much better fit. i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available.",0
169,41,,Comfy cozy!,0
169,41,,Great fit and very flattering if you have curves. perfect to throw over just about anything. i've only owned it for 9 days and have worn it four times.,10
169,42,Not a tunic,"This fits like a regular top for me. i can take petite on top most of the time. i bought this in a medium regular and it fits like my regular high low tees or tops. i think it's so cute on. it's light weight enough for warmer weather. i'm going to love it this spring/summer and into fall with a jacket or cardigan. another plus is it doesn't gape at the armpit which i get sometimes with regular cuts. it's not so low cut on me either, but i have a 32f (37-38ish inches) bust so that may be why? it",0
169,42,"Shimmers with gold, silver, and black tones",,1
169,42,Size down,"This top is really cute online, but that's about it.  it runs large, but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly.",6
169,43,Fun embellishment!,"Now this is a summer staple! love the design of the bib of this tee. super soft, great neutral charcoal color and can be dressed up or down. it is loose, i'd recommend sizing down.",1
169,43,Perfect wardrobe staple !,"Comfortable, thick material ( think: structured sweatshirt material) easy to throw on and look as if effort was made - when it wasn't. sizing. i'm between a large and xl usually. large was perfect. i'm tall and curvy: ( 36g curvy) and this cardigan/ belted jacket/is very flattering.",0
169,44,Looking sharp!,"I saw this and the ""giddy up"" tees at the store, and it was so difficult to decide because they have their own uniqueness. unlike the giddy up tee, this tee has no embroidery, but saying it has just patterns is underestimating it. the pattern is a work of art, it has cowboys, ranch scenery, cacti, and the earthly colors are gorgeous for all seasons (especially for those who still have a leftover summer tan). the hem of the tee is a bit round which i thought is unique and versatile for tucking in",0
169,45,,,0
169,46,Can't stop thinking about this one,"I am on an retailer diet but i can't stop thinking about this top! tried it on with my sister when shopping and if only they'd had my size in stock i'd have been a goner for sure. it is super comfy -- the fabric is somehow both lightweight and structured. while i'm kind of sick of high/low, this one manages to execute in a really subtle way that just manages to hide the bum without being in your face. love the sparkle -- you could wear this to work then out on a date or all weekend long. so versat",4
169,46,Choral ruffle top,"In the photo and from far away this top looks more elegant than it truly is. wearing it feels like something better suited for sleeping in. it's a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off and raw edges, which looks rather cheap and sloppy.",0
169,46,Fantastic sweater,"I ordered the navy/gray version in size xl. it fits me true to size, matching the online photos. the colors matched too. the fabric is so soft. it's warm while being lighter in weight. very comfortable. the collar wasn't bulky either. it's made to last. one of my retailer favorites.",0
169,47,Looks like maternity wear,"First, it's huge. i'm not big busted but it's so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant. not exactly what i was going for. nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in--and i'm short waisted so no tucking for me. back it went.",0
169,47,Not a tunic,"I just purchased this top in the store. it is definitely not tunic length as shown here, but rather hip length. also it runs a little small in the bust and had to go up a size. but it is adorable.",3
169,48,Cute shirt,I agree with the other reviewers. this shirt is cuter in person. it is a flattering cut and the design is even prettier than in the photos. the color is more navy--not the charcoal color it looks in the photos. the stitching is also more colorful in real life.,1
169,48,Unique design,This really is a pretty top. i do wish it was a little thicker but it's not as see-through as other tees i've seen.,0
169,49,Seems to run a bit small,"I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings, but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though.",0
169,50,Fun sweatshirt,"Cute sweatshirt with fun print. i bought it using retailer discount, and probably would not have paid full price for it. embroidery is a nice touch. i ordered an xs, which fits fine, but the overall design of the shirt is a little short and boxy. i did not realize until it arrived that the back of the shirt is a v neck. it's not a deep v, but it feels a little odd at first.",3
169,52,"Fun, soft, light weight","I have featured a picture below. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. i ordered an xs petite. i'm pretty busty so i don't like a loose fitting top, so ordering a size down did the trick. it's super soft, one of a kind and the edging of the neckline is delicate looking and soft and therefore adds a feminine element. i'm enjoying wearing the top.",0
169,53,,Very very cute. bought in store yesterday. put it on today to wear and it is huge. i normally buy a large in tshirts. i will return for either a small or medium but will try on in the store. oh well.,15
169,54,Comfy but classy,This product is amazing. i love that it's comfortable and stylish at the same time. i love the unique color pattern and the length of this product. i also love that i can wear to any occasion and can dress it up or dress it down. it's very versatile and i love it.,0
169,54,Very pretty linen tee but scratchy & transparent,"I ordered this in a petite small; a petite xs would have fit too. fits just like on the model. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37ish with narrow shoulders and torso. the regular size proportions would have been off on me. lovely pattern on a milky white background.
.
i'm returning it because it feels so scratchy, much more than a linen tee i got from retailer a few years ago and that i love, especially in hot weather. with this one i would also need to wear a cami under it, as even my nude bra showed",2
169,56,Nothing special,"I thought this would look great with skirts, but all my skirts are too dressy for this t-shirt. that's really all it is -- a nothing-special t-shirt. and it runs so big! i'm usually a large or xl in tops, but for this one i bought a medium, and it's still too big. i think a small would have been fine. but, as i mentioned, it doesn't go with any of my skirts, so it's not worth looking for a small.",0
169,57,Versatile comfort,"Great wardrobe staple! at 119, i ordered the s and the fit was great. you can wear this so many ways and it's soft!",2
169,59,Excessive shrinking,"This is a cute top but unfortunately when i washed it (delicate, cold water, line dry) it shrunk excessively in length. i'm very disappointed.",1
169,59,Yee haw!,"So i fell in love with the print without even noticing that it had horses on it until after it arrived! i was sooo excited! but really the length and fit are the best part about this shirt. with my long torso things are generally too short on me. i'm a sucker for spending money on clothes but still i wish retailer could make cute tees for under 40 bucks:/ i say that, yet i'm not sending it back:)",0
169,60,Perfect!,"This is one of my favorite purchases ever-from anywhere! one of my new years resolutions was to stop wearing work out clothes all of the time. this is as comfortable as any work out jacket and looks classy. can be dressed up or down. its warm, flattering and unique.",1
169,62,Love this tunic!,Really cute over my white cropped pilcro jeans. or as a beach cover up over a bathing suit. i want this in more colors!,11
169,62,,"I ordered 2 sizes to try for in store pickup. both were too large, so size down (i am 5'4"", 125 lbs and the s was too large in the neck and body, even though i generally wear things large). also, the collar was a hemmed flat collar, not the roll collar depicted. i reviewed that with the salesperson as well -- we were both at a loss to explain why, and the tiger embellishments were more orange, yellow and glittery on the ones i ordered.",2
169,65,I absolutely love it,This t shirt is very beautiful. i absolutely love it. it is soft and flattering and gorgeous - perfect for work or play. i washed it in gentle cycle cold water. i meant to hang to dry but somehow it got in the dryer with towels. i was heart sick when i saw it in a crumpled ball. but it did not shrink nor wrinkle. wow!,0
169,65,Nostalgia tee,"Precious tee, washes well, runs large",1
169,66,Darling little basic tee,"I just couldn't resist the western scene and it doesn't disappoint. i ordered size large and although it's a bit long for me, it flows nicely over my hips. i had to try it on with several different bottoms and find it looks great with shorts and skinny or boyfriend jeans. just darling under a jean jacket and cardigan too. the fabric isn't thin or heavy. wasn't it goldilicks who said: it's just right! i love the uniqueness of the print that is just edgy and different enough to translate to great,",3
169,67,Best t-shirt,Love this t-shirt....i will be wearing this until it wears out. very soft; great fit; and very comfortable....,2
169,68,The pleats in this jacket are unruly,"Despite the fact that this jacket is made from a gorgeous ottoman looking knit fabric, and has perfect fit, nice arm length, looks good on the hanger, the jacket did me no justice at all. it arrived folded, in the mail, so i had to press down the unruly pleats before i could try it on (you have to do this with nearly every item you buy online that comes folded flat and stuck in a cellophane bag.). so i pressed the jacket, tried to neaten the pleats but to no avail. the pleats would not stay put",2
169,77,Very cool shirt,"This t is so pretty in person. the gold is metallic with embroidered detail. this is my first purchase of this brand, so my usual size medium fit just fine. i am excited to put this under one of my blazers for a casula friday. it is quite unusual and great quality.",5
169,82,Western t,"This is a cute t with colors that blend with so many things i already have in my closet.
and, i love the western theme which isn't at all girly. usually i purchase v-neck items because
they suit me best, but i couldn't pass up the idea of cactus and succulents. it will be a fun
shirt to wear.",0
170,20,Would wear it every day if i could,"Absolutely fantastic top, the cut is very flattering and the colors are gorgeous in the pattern (i also bought the white).",1
170,21,Terrific turtleneck tanktop,This shirt is super comfortable and super chic. it looks great and feels great.,0
170,23,Cute tank,"I did not purchase because it was too low cut for my liking, but otherwise really liked this top. i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference",5
170,23,Flowy,I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!,1
170,23,Pretty blouse,"Made of casual materials, perfect for drinks or to be used as a vacation top. has a very flattering cut and pretty design with chiffon trim on top.",0
170,25,Perf for casual outing,"I saw this shirt in store a while ago, but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it. however, when it went on sale and there was an extra 40%, i decided to get it. i like the top, it's cute and fun. however, it does poof out a little in the midline. this top goes great with jeans or shorts, and it is cute, but definitely not worth full price for this.",0
170,25,,"Cute pattern, but the shirt is very thin and runs small and short!",0
170,26,Good staple,My normal size m fit well but i wouldn't want it to shrink any. hangs well.,0
170,27,Could have been great,"I really loved how this top looked and was really excited it to get it on sale. i was worried that it might be too small/tight (i ordered a m and would consider myself a m) but was relieved to find it fit just fine. i was extremely disappointed to find that it was too sheer to wear by itself and still showed my bra with a layering tank on underneath. it was also more like a crop top for length, which does not work with my mama belly.",0
170,27,Cute peplum top!,,0
170,27,Cute top! run large,"This is a great swingy tank for summer and the smocking adds a nice design element to an otherwise plain white top. i typically wear a l, sometimes xl in tops from retailer, but the l in this is pretty loose - i am hoping it will shrink down quite a bit in the wash. otherwise i really love the top, and now that it's on sale, the price is definitely right! i wish the black one was still available!",0
170,27,Flattering shirt,"Although i was worried it wouldn't live up to its sticker price, i'm glad i bought this shirt. it is extremely flattering in the way it drapes. the lace details make it seem dressy and special. the fabric feels luxurious. sleeves are almost too short for my long arms, but they are good enough.",0
170,27,Patterned peplum top,"Adorable! very pleased with the quality of the fabric and the very comfortable fit. i'm sure i'll wear this with jeans, as pictured, but can also see it with a breezy summer skirt.",3
170,28,Very flattering top,"This shirt is very flattering, which is not the case for all peplum tops. v-neck is appropriate for work. looks great with jeans or khakis. highly recommend! only con is that the material is quite thin. 5'3"" 115 lbs and xs fit perfectly.",0
170,28,Wanted to love it....!,"I really wanted to love this blazer...i've even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around. (spoiler: it didn't :( ). overall, it makes me look pretty frumpy and not put together. i really love saturday/sunday brand and was hoping for a nice comfy blazer to wear to work. will be returning instead.",5
170,29,Love this top!,I love how it fits very flattering! the quality of the cotton part of this top is a little less in quality of that fabric than i expected. but i love this top and i foresee wearing it all year round!,0
170,29,Way too large in the waist,"Definitely size down, the waist and chest were baggy in my normal size s.",0
170,30,Darling and sophisticated,,0
170,30,Great tank,"Love the fabric, print, and cut! it's a smidge low in the neckline, but that's probably because i'm busty. nice and breezy for our blazing hot and humid florida summers.",0
170,31,Cute top!,"This was really cute and fit true to size. the only thing i didn't love was the dip on the top left side of the tank near the cleavage. i probably shouldn't have been surprised since it actually shows up in the picture on the model, but it doesn't lay flat correctly there like the right side. either way, it's still very flattering and cute.",1
170,31,Cute weekend top,,0
170,32,Comfy & cute,Love the feminine styling of a classic tunic tee! i'll wear it with black leggings this fall. super cute to wear casually or dress up a bit with some jewelry and/or a scarf.,1
170,32,Fun summer tank,"This top is all around great for summer... i've worn it to festivals, for casual workwear, etc. love the colors, they're vibrant. this top could even be worn on the warmer days of fall with a light jacket over it.",0
170,32,Really nice top,"I really love this top, great colors, comfortable, long enough (always a problem for me), light but feels quality fabric and nice details.",0
170,32,Run large,"I love the idea of ruffles, but this shirt was huge! i normally wear a small or medium, and i got the small. it felt more like a large to me. maybe if you size down 1-2 sizes, it will work out for you. i'm going to take it back rather than exchange. i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer, but it's pretty thick.",3
170,33,Basic top with frills!,"The pattern attracted me to this top in store and when i tried it on, i was pleasantly surprised it has a slight swing shape to it which i love. i'm a 36c/d and normally wear an 8 or 10 and bought this in a large. the front buttons don't peek open and actually lays flat which is unusual for me with button up tops. i'm actually wearing it today with some printed green shorts. the stripes on this top make it easy to mix patterns, too :)",27
170,33,,Love this shirt it has a femine look with a casual style.,0
170,34,Great tank just not for me,The sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area. i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately. it truly is a great tank top!,0
170,34,Super slimming,"I ordered a size large.  i recently had a baby and was looking for a top to hide my baby belly until i lose it.  this shirt fits amazingly.  i don't find the sleeves to be snug at all.  if the shirt wasn't so distinctive, i'd order in several colors.  the quality is fantastic for a tee and has a nubbed appearance you can't see in the photos.",6
170,34,,Love this top. purchased for family photos and i think it's great. personally i don't think the model shot is doing it justice - it's much prettier in person. runs true to size for retailer. i am a 34d and i purchased a small.,17
170,34,,The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.,3
170,35,Beautiful blouse,,0
170,35,Such a cute top,"I was so excited to get this top in the mail. i loved the colors, print, cut, everything. i put it on and was so disappointed, the top looks so much better on the model. i don't know if i should have gone down a size (i go between an xs and s), but it looked terrible on me! my husband took one look at me in it and said that's being returned. still disappointed",0
170,36,Cute sweatshirt,"I found this to be true to size (m fit me well - 5'7"", 140 lb, usually a size m for tops). it does have a straight fit, and it hits at the waist. i wouldn't call it cropped, but if you prefer longer tops you may want to layer. it looks cute with a collared shirt underneath, and you can pull the shirt's cuffs over the sweatshirt. the sleeves were a great length.",0
170,36,Love love,,0
170,36,Versatile top,"This top is beautiful and fits true to size, 4ft 11inches and 114 lbs and i purchased the xs. i was at the montclair location today and they had this top in white, lavendar, the pattern which is displayed online and gray. the white was see through so you will definitely have to wear an under garment with it. this top will be perfect for the spring with a cardigan or by itself in the summer. i still have a little stomach left over from my second pregnancy and this top hides it well. i decided to",18
170,36,,"I was surprised how much i like this shirt. the fit is really pleasing. at first i thought it would be a ""whatever"" shirt, but i think i will actually wear it a lot more. it will look cute dressed up with a cute necklace and flats. the price is a bit high for this top, but i felt it was worth it since it is so hard finding a casual shirt thats not your basic tee.",3
170,37,Cute colorful top,"I love this tank - the colors are great and the fit is flattering. the fabric is lightweight but not cheap or so thin that you need to wear something under it. i am 5'7"" and the length was fine for me.",0
170,37,Dressy casual,Great sweater with gorgeous detail. fits tts. works best in someone with smaller bust like me. pink is peachy pink like other reviewers have commented. pairing it with gray ag jeans! will work great for fall/winter in louisiana.,0
170,37,Flattering fit,"Great top for all seasons. hides imperfections, flatters hourglass shapes. and great thickness/weight to fabric. i'm wearing it to a concert with skinny moto jeans and booties! side zip is excellent feature and great quality.",0
170,38,Great top - wish it came in more colors,"This tank is well made and the top part is doubled (partially) so you can get away without wearing a bra (if you wish). i'm 5'1 and tried on the standard xs in store because xxs was not available. it was a little bit longer on me than on the model pictured. the pin-tucked area fit well, not too tight or loose and the bottom part was flowy which i don't mind. i expect this top to shrink in the wash a tad which would make it perfect for me. i opted for the white vs. the black because i love the pi",6

170,38,Not as pictured,I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back.,1
170,38,Started out perfect,"Loved the style, ordered my normal m- fit tts though i thought i would potentially taper the sides to make less boxy (with a larger bust and shoulders, boxiness is unflattering). the slight boxiness looked perfect with stretchy, fitted business slacks. midday, i held my ipad up to my chest and the velcro from the cover pulled an entire lychnis delicate threads. not just snagged- i had to gently separate the threads from velcro grip. needless to say, it pulled the threads out by at least 1/2 an i",1
170,39,Basic but not boring,"Great basic tee with just the right amount of extra detail. the length is perfect--not too long, not too short. fit is relaxed and comfortable without looking sloppy. i'm coming back for more colors!",0
170,39,Fun summer top,"I tried on the pink version, really nice, the fit is loose, but flattering. opening at the neck looks nice either tied or not. fabric is airy. it looked nice tucked in or with a wide leg pant. i passed only because the color wasn't as bright as i need for my pale skin. overall, very nice. 

xs fit at 115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist",1
170,39,Great peplum top,I love the fit of the peplum top. it's flattering without being too full on the bottom. the print is lovely and great for summer and spring!,0
170,39,"Material too thin, too wide on bottom","Based on other reviews that this top ran large, i ordered this online in two sizes. both seemed to fit alright in my chest (although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size), and both were much too big on the bottom. the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats, so the bottom of this top really, really, really flared out away from my hips. the length seemed fine on me (5'10""). the material is very thin, and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern.",0

170,39,The print is interesting,"I kept this one because it was different enough and good to wear casually and to work. i'm not sure how this material will hold up with washing, since it's basically a thin cotton material. it fits perfectly, so i'm worried that it will shrink. i give it a thumbs up for the design, but sale cost and material is like something you would find at forever 21.",0

170,40,Cute top!,"I purchased the teal/blue version and the colors are slightly muted, but very pretty. i wish it were a tad bit longer, but if you're looking for a shirt that does not look like a tunic, this is ideal. it's cotton, so it feels like a t-shirt, but with a much more elevated design and cut. a cute and easy top!",0
170,40,Great layering piece,"I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans, and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like, but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer, i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.",0
170,40,Great purchase if on sale!,"I purchased this top on sale and it's almost perfect. the pleats under the rib cage make the bottom bell out a little bit - not enough to make me want to return it, but i'm glad i didn't pay full price!",0
170,40,Great summer top,I gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it! i get many compliments on this top! i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls :),0
170,40,Nice jacket to put outfit together,,0
170,40,The beauty is in the details,"I love design of this top! it will look beautiful on many body types. the black material is thin, and for my personal level of comfort i will definitely wear a cami under. the details are gorgeous and the neutral colors easy to combine with casual or dressy bottoms. the top ran true to size for me.",1
170,40,,This is a really pretty top that you can dress up or down. the draping on the neck and shoulders falls nicely and i love the back with the lace. it is simple but unique and has nice classic lines. i am usually a pxs but based on the measurements i went with the regular xxs and glad i did bc the petite would have been too short.,0
170,41,Adore! but the white *is* sheer,"I own this in the dark blue and adore it. i read reviews later as i was pondering buying the white (why is it so hard to find a white shirt anymore that isn't see-through?!). one of the first reviewers raved that it wasn't see-through. i ordered it and ... nope, it's totally see-through. i tried it on and immediately saw the entire outline of my nude bra, and worse still - my belly button. back it went. i got the green instead. bummer about the white - fabric's different than the others.",0
170,41,Flattering tank,"I purchased the coral color. i'm usually between an xs and small in this brand, and i felt the top runs a tad small, so the small fit much better. simple and flattering top.",1
170,41,Great trendy tee!,"Love! the detailing is so pretty! and finally!!! it's a top that's comfortably long. retailer has been making all of their tops so short lately! i'm 5'7"" and a dd. i ordered a large simply because it's a cotton tee and i didn't want a fitted look, per se. my only criticism would be that the material is a little thin in the front. i just ordered it in black too!",2
170,41,Pretty piece,"This is a pretty everyday piece to add to your wardrobe. the color is a little less pink and more peach than depicted in the photo and the top is just a bit on the short side but i was afraid that if i sized up, it wouldn't give me more length but maybe look boxy instead. i'm 5'7"", 140lbs, 32dd with an athletic build and ordered the small.",9
170,41,,,0
170,42,Love the color!,I love this shirt so much i am ordering the coral too! the weight of the material makes it hang nicely. there is a lot of material but it lends itself to the flowy style. i got many compliments of this top!,3
170,43,Beautiful lace,"I loved this blouses when i saw it on-line, but when i saw it in on me it looked totally different. it runs really large and i didn't like the material of blouse.",3
170,43,Comfortable and relaxed look,"The quality and design of this top is great and it goes well with my skinny jeans and wide-leg linen trousers. only thing is that it does need to air dry or i imagine it will shrink up which would not be good for taller frames. i'm slim, 5'8"" and got an xs and it fits just right. the carbon color appears to have hints of blue/purple on screen, but it's actually a plain dark gray.",2
170,43,Elegant top,"I was shopping for a holiday outfit today at my retailer store, and my sales associate suggested i try on this top. i have lo idea where it was on the store l, yet it's a very pretty top that stands out when you have it on. i took this in a small because it's meant to run shorter. i felt xs would have been too small. i purchased it to wear with jeans or dress pants. pretty detail. blouse shows off my arms and minimizes my waist. i love it!",7
170,43,Love,"This is such a beautiful top, so flattering, soft and comfortable.  it is great as a layering piece.  the colors are vibrant.  the blue is a gorgeous blue, a deep cobalt blue.  i got one in every color.",0

170,45,Beautiful top,"I love this top. it looks exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. i ordered the black and it is somewhat sheer. the material has a slight burnout effect. the black can be worn without a cami but if i wear it to work, i will need to add one.",2
170,45,Bunches up...,"I saw this on sale, and it looked lovely online. i really wanted to love it when i received it. it looked great, but once i tried it on, it bunches up in the back. it looks awkward. the lace and small details are pretty, but the fit is just off. returned it in the store.",0
170,46,Love this adorable breezy look.,"This is one of my favorite tops! i have it in two colors. it's almost like a swing look, yet it still feels like it gives me a shape to my body. very easily paired with a skinny jean. i paid full price for th two, but now i'm sure i'll buy the third on sale!",7
170,46,"Lovely, dressy tee",I love this t-shirt! it's a little bit dressy because of the lace but the t-shirt material is great for casual wear. i tried on the white but ended up buying the black because the white is so sheer. i'll still have to wear a layering tank with it but the black just feels less sheer for some reason. really cute and nice quality t-shirt!,3

170,49,Beauty meets comfort,"I love this top, the details at the neck and shoulders are lovely, both front and back. it's also very comfortable and soft, allowing you look nicely dressed while feeling like you are wearing a soft tee-shirt. the sleeves are a good length with some elastic at the cuffs so you can push them up. sadly, it's sold out in in my size online and in the stores, otherwise i would certainly snap it up at the sale price.",0
170,49,Classic style with nice details,"This is a very pretty top with nice lace details. the linen makes it not quite as soft as 100% cotton but still comfortable and breathable. the fit was just right in the small petite. i tried it on in the store and was very tempted, but wound up not buying it because i have other similar tops. i would snap it up if it went on sale or if i needed a top of this type.",0
170,49,"Pretty colors, nice fit",I love the teal/aqua version. the colors are very pretty and look great with jeans. i got a medium. it runs a tiny bit small but a lot of fitted tops at retailer run smaller on me. i like the style a lot and the peplum is great.,0
170,50,Looks cute - but sheds!,"This jacket looked adorable on. it was also quite comfortable. however, it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched. sadly, this is a deal breaker for me.",4

170,51,Beautiful relaxed sweatshirt,"Love this sweatshirt! i'm 5'2"" 110lbs and ordered the x-small. it's a little boxy but very comfy. it's definitely light peach in color and not pink, as shown. very happy with this purchase!",3

170,51,Love this top!!,"I bought it in the cream color and loved it so much that i bought it in black too. super cute with jeans! can dress it up too. the only slight negative, if i had to find one, is that i feel like i have to pull it forward, at the neckline every once in a while...it doesn't choke me but just feels like it's heavier in the back so pulls a bit. worth it though! :)",1
170,52,Great top,"Love this top - on sale, i bought two of this color, a grey and the green, i never buy more than one of anything unless i absolutely love it ! complimentary to the body, and the colors are beautiful. i'm 5'2"" there were no pxs so i opted for xs, perfect... thanks retailer ??",0

170,61,Great top,"I usually wear a medium in tops from deletta so i would say this top is true to size. i personally loved the fit. in the front, the seam goes up slightly to follow the bust line. there are some gathers in that area as well so that any little bulges in the tummy area are hidden. the fabric falls nicely there. the seam at the waist on the side and back hit exactly at my waist. i love both of the prints. the tops seem to be well made. time will tell.",0
170,62,I own this top in 3 colors!,"I bought the gray and white to take on a trip. i wore it nearly every other day. looks good layered with a cami or short sleeved t-shirt. also threw on a blazer one chilly night and it looked nice enough to have a dinner out.came home and bought it in red and white and solid white. true to size. not clingy, not baggy and comes down just long enough to cover the tummy.",0
170,63,Great white top.,"Finally, a white top that does not show every nook and cranny. this is a great fabric. many times white shirts are see thru and i won't buy them. this top is lightweight but has enough substance to cover everything. the online picture does not do it justice.
it can be worn with anything and is made very well. this one's a keeper for your closet and will be worn over and over all summer long.",2
170,64,,A nice comfy sweatshirt. i do wish it was just a tad longer; tends to run a little short and therefore looks a little boxy and i'm only 5'3! (i purchased the regular size not the petite)also the front wool insert is a little scratchy as it is not lined on the inside.,1
170,65,Beautiful basic! a find!,"This is a very appealing and flattering tee! the details really make this quite lovely: the back pleat makes the fit fabulous and motion ideal, the stitching at the neckline is attractive and artistically pleasing, the proportions are balanced, nothing too full or tight. although the tee is 100% cotton, the pocket is 100% polyester, quite silky and a nice accent. i bought the ""white"", which is more of an ivory and gorgeous, with complementary deeper ivory stitching. my usual medium fits great (s",22

170,74,"Gorgeous top, classic retailer","I have purchased many of retailer's henley tees throughout the years. this one is a bit special and just so feminine i had to get it black in my local store. i love the look of the crisp, white, but it was too sheer to wear to work without a cami, and i cannot layer camis in once it gets hot.

172,26,Perfect seasonal transition top,"I fell in love with this top as soon as i tried it on; it's the perfect spring-to-summer top. the fabric is light and airy, and the brown stripes give it a lackadaisical vibe. the little buttons on the back are a cute detail that really give something extra to an otherwise simple top, and the v-neck did not reveal any cleavage. i bought this in a large, and i'd say it runs a little on the larger side, but i like that because it adds to the comfortable, flowy nature of the design. for reference,",1
172,26,,I love this top! i originally bought the brown/purple pattern and wore it all the time so when i saw the blue and yellow on sale i had to get it. the fabric is really soft and breezy - perfect for the spring to summer weather. the sleeves are a little long on me but doesn't bother me. it runs a little large but works with my style. i would have sized down but it wouldn't have fit in the bust (i'm a 36d). i definitely recommend this top!,1

178,42,Narrow shoulders,"I totally agree with the last reviewer. i'm 5'2"" 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders. the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn't move my arms. the small was better but was too big in the torso. the material itself was really nice. too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering.",0
178,42,So pretty!,"I bought this and like other reviews, agree that the quality probably could be better, but i still love it enough to keep. the buckle fell apart, but i was able to fix it and the zipper seems a little weak. it has pilled, but the fabric is textured, so i didn't even notice until i read the other reviews and then looked back at my jacket.  it is a perfect medium coat for 40's & 50's before i am ready to bust out my ugly down north face for winter.  i get compliments every time i wear it!  love!!",0

178,52,Wanted to love this,"I had my eye on this coat for so long. when i saw it was on sale and an extra 30% off i decided to go for it. i ignored the reviews that said it ran big and took a chance and sadly it did not pay off. this jacket is very heavy so if you are going to get it on sale, it will probably go into the closet for next winter. it was very boxy on me and tied at the waist, made my upper half look huge. it was just not flattering at all. the heaviness of it also made the big open neck a little annoying and",0
178,53,Much nicer in person,Such a pleasant surprise. i saw this in the store and had to try it on. it looks and feels like a lightweight real suede. the color is a wonderful neutral-much prettier than what i am seeing in the pic here. fits tts. although i will wear 0-2 petites in dresses and some pants i found the regular xs to be just right.,2
178,54,Gorgeous & warm,"I bought this coat shortly after christmas and am in love. it is meant to fit oversize but runs true to your natural sizing. i am a m/l in most retailer clothing and that is what i bought. it is great for layering for a dressed up look with a skirt or dress for work and also dressed down with jeans a t-shirt. and, although the arms are 3/4 length it is super warm! so happy i purchased!",3

179,65,Love this skirt--get it,"This is a beautiful skirt and such a great piece to collect from erin fetherston.

the design and cut are very flattering on a variety of body types. i have more of a curvy shape and love this type of cut to accentuate my smaller waste (rather than fitted dresses/skirts that hug).

180,43,Soft but color not quite like pictured,"So i thought this sweater would be snowy white, but it's actually a beige kind of dingy color. i do not mean that it's unattractive, i do like it, just because it is not snowy white like i thought, it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater. it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured. it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either. it's a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the top.the picture does no",5
180,43,This looks different in person,"I don't think the sweater looks like the one pictured. it's pretty and i love off the shoulder sweaters, but i have to say it's a little scratchy and its a lighter grey than what shows on my computer screen. if i hadn't gotten it on sale and with an additional birthday discount i would send it back. it also runs big. i got an xs/s and it fits perfectly. im 5'6"" and weigh 140. i usually wear a medium in most things and am a size 8. i like it a lot, but i don't love it. it also reeked of patchouli",2

181,56,That's not a wrap,"I chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure, but was disappointed. the fabric is a beautiful soft, fine silk, but unforgiving. the cut is not truly a wrap, and, with a fixed thin elastic waistband, was too short waisted for me. while the model looks elongated, the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections... not flattering at all. while i was drawn to the shape for my body type, it may be better suited to another. happy hunting!",0

first, it is way too short for me, especially on the sides because of the war the ruffled bottom lay, to wear as a dress. it was more tunic length- but i wouldn't want to wear pants underneath because it would take away from the overall aesthetic. also, the ruffled sleeves give me unwanted volume th",2

189,33,"Great, cozy, all-weather sweater","I bought this for an upcoming late-september seaside trip because it looked like it would be warm enough for cooler nights, but not too warm because of the open weave. i just received it yesterday, and i adore it. i got the pink color and was really torn between the green and the pink. i was hoping the pink would look more beige from far away (per one of the other reviews) and i was happy that it does. up close you can really see the pink, but from an arm's length away or more, it looks beige wi",7
189,34,Stylish flair,,0
189,35,Wanted to love this,"So, this is a super soft comfy sweater. the color is great and i really wanted to love it. but the dolman sleeves sort of annoyed me. that being said, all of the good things about this sweater almost made me keep it. the neckline is also really neat. it drapes nicely, and stays that way. if you are on the fence give it a try!",0

189,36,,"This is one of my favorite sweaters of the season. it is warm and cozy and looks so cute with jeans. it's definitely a little shorter on me than it looks on the model, even though i'm only 5'4.",0
189,37,Nope!,Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!,2
189,38,New wardrobe staple,"I can tell already that this sweater is going to be in heavy rotation in my closet. it's a bit oversized and cozy, but the ribbon tie makes it neat and not sloppy. great with skinny jeans, flares or leggings. super cute with a cami underneath.",0
189,39,Comfy,"Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape, but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long, but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.",0
189,39,Get creative,"Get creative with the neckline or let it fall where ever. this is a purposefully slouchy, uber casual, super soft",0
189,39,Large with no shape,"This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses, sometimes medium in sweaters.
it seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied, there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist.",1
189,39,Love at first site,I am in love with this sweater. i am 5'4 and wear a size 8 and bought a large. perfect length and fit. will wear with jeans or leggings. the quality was amazing and i can't wait to wear it!,2
189,41,Great sweater,,1
189,42,Not soft,"I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.",3
189,42,"Size down, but how far down? tricky sizing.","My store had only one of these, in a size xs (i tend to be more of a s in most retailer items). it was roomy. i am 5'2, 34d, & figured a petite small would be a perfect fit. i ordered the ps, it arrived today, & is still pretty big! the sleeves (which are quite flared) are a little shorter, as is the overall length, than the regular xs, but overall the ps feels just as big, if not bigger, than the regular xs! trying to decide if i should go back for the regular xs or order the regular xxs.",0
189,42,,"Gorgeous and soft, luxurious feeling sweater! i purchased this in the pink/purple color that is no longer showing as available and just love it. it's unbelievably soft, feels like a blanket. i found that if you sort of fold the neck line under a little, it drapes like a cowl neck a little and not quite as off the shoulder....as it's very cold where i am...can't see wearing it that far off during the winter! that was my solution and i love it! i'm typically and xs, bought the xxs b/c it appeared",21
189,44,Love this sweater!!,"This sweater is so beautiful, soft, and warm. the neck is a little different and meant to be worn off the shoulder. i don't wear it off the shoulder. if you just work with it a bit it will lay nicely. i get compliments every time i wear it!!",1

189,47,Great price (on sale) but sheds too much!,,0
189,48,Disappointed by shedding,"I tried this on in-store because i needed a cozy cardigan, but i did not buy it because i felt the quality was poor. it shed all over everything i tried on with it, and i left the store with little balls of sweater flufff all over my pants. disappointed.",0

189,48,Unique sweater like summer top!,"I fell in love with this piece the moment i saw it. unfort they were out of the s, so i went with a medium. fortunately for me, this piece runs true to size and so while slightly large, i will still keep it. the material is sturdy and of good quality, the buttons are large and noticeable and the ties by the shoulder are not flimsy. great piece!",0
189,49,Unique fall sweater,"I was attracted to this sweater because of it's unique style. i really love it. it looks just like the picture. it is of good quality, as is the leather belt. it is the perfect fall sweater and i love that it's different. i highly recommend this sweater.",1
189,52,Looks better in the pic than real life,"I really liked the look of the orange so ordered an xs. i prefer a s petite but it is sold out. the xs arrives and while i still like the color, the fit is really weird. the cowl is very high up but the sleeves are still long. it looks nothing like the photo. i cannot see how the cowl sits on the model's collar bone. despite eliding the color, the design is off so have to return.",0
189,52,Nice addition to my fall wardrobe,,1
189,53,Better in real life!,"I bought this sweater in the sky color. just love it, i'll go back for the rust colored one.",1
189,53,Saundra tank,"The saundra tank is a very pretty and feminine knitted top. it is soft and comes in a very delicate pink color.
i took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges. it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it. the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra. it is a rather loose fit, so if you prefer something more form fitting, you might opt for a smaller size.",0
189,54,Great pullover !,,0
189,54,Sublime,"Lovely sweater! it's a new staple in my wardrobe. love the fit and styling, but what drew me in at first sight were the colors. it's warm and cuddly.",0

189,55,Beautiful periwinkle softness,This sweater is gorgeous! the color is a true periwinkle which really attracted me to it. the bell sleeves are a nice change. i have very long arms and they fit perfectly. i could wear this sweater out.,2
189,59,Love style,Really nice green blend of colors. fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum. i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket. is a bit itchy. need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath.,0
189,59,Returning,This sweater is beautiful but runs large all over. i ordered a m and returning for a small. hopefully that works.,0
189,60,Great sweater,I just got this sweater and it really is a great fall weight. i disagree with other reviewers that it is oversized and that the sleeves are long. i found the sleeves to be just right and it to fit normally. i almost wish i got a medium just so it would be a little baggier and the sleeves would be a little longer. i got the green and am really happy with the color.,0
189,60,Lovely color,"This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.",0
189,64,A great long swtr w/ patch pockets!,"I ordered my usual sz s during the promo. arrived yesterday & the fit is perfect w/ a little room to spare for layering. it's a snap front closure, front patch pockets, & attached hood that is small to med size-not huge or overwhelming. it's 100% acrylic which isn't my 1st choice, but soft, comfy & seems good quality. length falls abt 3"" below my knees. arm length is fine. pretty much looks as in the pic including the marled color. if you are in need of a great functional long swtr w/ good looks",6
189,65,"Comfortable, attractive, cozy sweater.","Beautiful, comfortable and attractive sweater! my neckline doesn't stay flat as the one in the photo does, but i love the sweater anyway. great quality, attractive, and comfortable.",0
189,65,Simply lovely and so cozy!,"Knitted and knotted makes such gorgeous sweaters:  this is bathed in lovely, almost impresssionistic color, and the deep ruffle at the bottom is feminine and flattering.  i adored the way there's enough wrap-around to get cozy in it, as i wore it through my day.  i went with the green in a regular medium, which is my normal size:  size 8, 34f.  the 27% mohair enhances the soft feeling and lush look.  as i wore this piece today, i felt that i was wearing something very special.",0
189,72,Not worth the price.,"This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy, and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price, but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos, but unfortunately in person were not quality garments.",1
190,29,Nice skirt,"I disagree with the other reviewer - i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality, and while it wasn't lined i don't think lining is typical in a sweater material. i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape. i usually wear a 6 or 8, but my store only had a 4 available. it fit, but was a little tight in the hips. the skirt was also longer on me then on the model, but i'm on the short side.",3
190,34,What you see is what you get,"I'm actually surprised no one has reviewed this yet. i took the plunge because it seemed like a classic wardrobe staple, nothing too flashy or fancy, that would go well with many outfits. my thoughts below:
__________________
pros:
- fits tts. i'm normally either a 10 or 12 and got the large. it fit well and the elastic isn't too tight. fit very well for me because i have wider hips. so if you're straight or slim, you could probably size down.
- exactly as pictured. it does have a nice flow",1
190,35,Flawed,,3
190,41,Would be great but...,"Such a cute skirt- but impossible to get on. ordered in an xs (i have a 25/26 waist) but could barely get it past my knees to step into. if you have any hips at all, unfortunately this skirt won't work. i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small.",11
190,43,Not impressed,"Had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits. however, that was not the case. this skirt is not lined and the material is so so. basically, for the price, i was underwhelmed and will return it.",6
190,44,Can't get it on,I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.,2
190,45,Cute skirt in theory,"This looked like such a cute, casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said, it runs small. i'm usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on. i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips. however once on, i couldn't figure out how i'd wear this. i wouldn't pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didn't seem like a good idea either. between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha",2
190,49,"Beautiful fabric, poor zipper craftsmanship","I tried this on in the store, and the fabric is lovely - so, so soft and drapey. the skirt is very flattering - good length. but the zipper! the zipper was already ripped away from the fabric, so i wasn't able to purchase it. such a shame.",5
190,49,Cute,"Really cute skirt, but difficult to get on! i had to shimmy it over my hips due to the lack of a much needed zipper. i am not very curvy, so if you got them, forget it! i sent back the xs - hope the small is a little roomier because it will make a pretty summer skirt.",1
190,49,Perfect fit,Fits great and super flattering,2
190,53,Gorgeous,"This is the most beautiful and flattering skirt. it was a bit of an investment piece for me in that i just graduated from college, but i love that this skirt can be worn year round. it is more fitted at the top and then flows out at the bottom, making it super flattering. pictures do not do it justice!",0
191,41,Comfortable easy piece.,"So simple to throw on with jeans, or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft, really comfy. i haven't decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great, and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color, like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade.",0
191,42,,"While this is gorgeous in person, if you have a larger bust the v-neck will look really weird. because its so deep, it gets skewed(i'm a d cup). if only the v were 1 or 2 inches higher! unfortunately it's going back.",1
191,43,Slenderizing sweater,I'm 5'1 and a tad busty and this sweater i found to be most flattering. i saw it i. the store on was drawn to it. i love the shimmer but perhaps that's because the holiday feel is already in the air in nyc. the m fit great in both length pans width. it looked great with my straight black jeans and boots. i felt it made me look thin. thankful i bought it on a discount day! it's a fabulous sweater.,0
191,46,Super cool top,"This top looks just like you see it on the website - design is super cool and color is awesome, almost acid washed in areas. but know that this top is super, super thin and will not provide any warmth. i wish it were a bit thicker in fabric, it would have been perfect for the cool fall and going into winter especially for the price. the medium in this one fit me better than the small. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.",0
191,46,Very unique top,"I purchased in the raspberry, love this color and the asymmetrical design is super cool, and the color is unique - however i am on the fence. this knit top is very thin and for the price and to wear in the cold fall and going into winter i think i need it to be more of a light sweater or at least a thicker fabric. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs. and the small fits perfect. the sleeves are long which you tall gals will love.",0
191,64,Love the blue in this top,"I love the tie-dye look! i ordered the blue color in my usual size small. fit is tts. love it!. just a fyi: 1. on mine, one arm is a darker blue tie-dye, the other is very light (color variation). 2. the white band on the mock-neck doesn't give much, so be careful when putting on/taking off.  i think it's pricey, but ordered during the promo so that made it better. it came yesterday, put it on w/ my washed blue skinny jeans, out to dinner we went!",0
191,66,Great cardigan,"I ordered this because it looked to be a good fit for my casual lifestyle. and it doesn't disappoint! it's cozy, lightweight but warm, flows well and looks great tied or worn loose. i ordered my regular size large in the grey. it fits as shown, just a bit longer because i'm short. the color is more of a blue gray with white striations that are well placed. it's really striking for such a casual piece. very pretty. highly recommend.",0
191,66,Unique,"I ordered my normal size large and it fit well although a bit on the long side. the fabric has a waffle texture that's lightweight but warm and cozy. i got the blue and the color was a bit intense in combination with the tie dye affect and waffled texture. my favorite part are the lighter striations on the neck. that opening is really small. it just didn't suit me, so i returned but recommend giving it a try if it's calling your name.",0
192,24,Love it! hello fall!,"Love this jacket! this picture shows the sleeves rolled down, but in the stores they have them rolled up and i have to say that is how you'll most likely wear it as the sleeves might be too short if you rolled them down. however, it is still a fabulous fall coat! it does run slightly large, but it depends on how you want it to fit. i am typically a medium, and i bought the m/l because the xs/s was a little fought in the shoulders. i bought last weekend and already wore twice because it looks gre",0
192,30,Can't love enough,"This vest goes with literally everything. it is the perfect amount of added warmth - though it's a bit hard to fit under a coat. the only thing i will say negatively about it is that it seems to shed on the inside a bit... but otherwise the quality, color, and length are perfect. and i love the pockets!",0
192,31,"Really lovely, not for me","This coat is wonderful. it's boxy and drapes really nicely. the colors are beautiful and versitile. i love the pockets. the fabric is sturdy, but not heavy. i have nothing but good things to say about this coat. i had to return it, sadly, since it wasn't flattering on my hourglass shape. (i am 5'6"", 34dd-27-42 and the small fit well) if you're confident enough to hide your waste, go for it. your won't regret it.",0
192,31,,"I saw this in the store and was glad i didn't order it earlier online. i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person. i like more unusual and flattering pieces, and this just wasn't it. no compliments here.",0
192,33,I'm in love,"I've been stalking this beauty since it came out and when i saw it went on sale with an extra percent off code i knew i had to purchase. well worth the price i paid, a bit steep at full price. 

i went with a size medium- i usually take a small/2-4 in retailer tops and these days i'm around a 32c. i'm also tall with long arms. the design is very forgiving with the cropped sleeve and non-closing front so you have some wiggle room. it fits me like it was custom made. 

the material is a lightwei",1
192,36,Looked better in the picture,"Initially, i bought this because i liked the color and style of this trench coat. i thought it could look very chic and polished. the problem was it was too large and too wrinkly. i'm 5'2 (115 lbs) and ordered an xs because petite sizes were unavailable. but i realize that a petite xs would've been a better fit. also the sleeves were too long even with an xs. i've already returned the product.",1
192,40,Vintage style,,0
192,43,Not as pictured and described,"When i read car coat, i expect a little more weight. it really is just a thin, long blazer. also, the colors appear different online. i expected a red/maroon with bue and white stripe, so maybe i mis-read completely...? it is actually brown/mustard/beige combo. not what i expected, so it will be a return.",0
192,56,Unique & cosy coat/jacket,"Very happy i purchased this jacket - although to me it is really a coat. it fits wonderfully and is so soft. i appreciate the uniqueness - not the usual dull winter shades of black/gray/navy. although i live in minneapolis much of the winter & it will not be warm enough once the temps drop beyond 20 degrees, it is perfect for the in-between 21- 50 degree days. i am a size 6 (5'5"", 135 lbs). tried the small & medium. the s was a bit snug in the hips so chose the m and it is just right.",0
192,65,Just what i was searching for...,"I've been searching for a pretty & soft faux fur coat - finally found it hanging there in retailer! there was only one - a size small. it looked gorgeous, but thought i could use it a bit roomier. i'm a size 2/4, 5'5"" & about 118 lbs. i ordered a medium but it was huge. stayed with the small and am loving wearing this in our mild northeast winter. lots of compliments. lightweight and luxe. get it.",4
192,74,The outfit-maker,"I love lightweight coat-jackets, of which this is a great example. they effortlessly pull an outfit together and give real personality to simple staples. the unstructured linen, while indeed lined, gives this coat a casual drape for spring/summer. i see it paired with bright red joggers and a white t, with chambray or white linen pants, even as a chic beach cover-up. i un-tacked the cuffs to give the sleeves a simpler look, but it's decidedly day and casual as opposed to evening or work wear. fu",6
193,22,Pretty skirt,This skirt is beautiful- very different. it wasn't all that flattering on me due to the side pockets and back pleats- but all in all is a great skirt! i love the design and the fabric.,0
193,25,Really close to liking it - but planning to return,"The print of this skirt is so fun. i love how it's styled on the model, and i could see it being very versatile. i decided not to keep it because, mainly, it is pricey and i'm afraid it'll get easily damaged. if i would wear it, i think i'd be worried about sitting on a dirty chair or spilling something on my lap and it being really visible-- and then having to upkeep it through dry cleaning. the fabric's nice and good quality. but honestly, if the skirt were cheaper and the fabric were cotton a",2
193,41,So small!,"I opened the package and loved this skirt immediately. i held it up and the waist is tiny. i'm usually a size 6 but sometimes go for a size 8 at retailer (i'm 5'6"" and 126 lbs). i would have needed at least 4 extra inches in the waist band to close the zipper...i wonder if this is a british size 8 or something. this 8 is closer to a 4. really disappointed.",3

193,58,,"I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt, if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff, felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect, the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.",1

195,25,Sweet!,"I am 5'2"" and 125 pounds and wear a 4p. i ordered the size 4 with the willingness to hem them; my goal was to get this true high-wasted style, which is extremely flattering. when the pants arrived, i was first struck by their high quality fabric and the top notch tailoring. the fabric is substantial yet it drapes beautifully. the true high waist flatters, but the buttons and slant pocket details further whittle the waist. i am so happy with my purchase!",0
195,27,Not what i expected,"I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store, i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on, the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy, but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that, and it's so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low, so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides

195,36,Comfortable wardrobe staple,I just wore these and they were comfortable and didn't stretch our or become baggy throughout the day. i have three kids and am constantly moving. they're a nice in between weight and held up nicely. i have some from j.crew that stretch out and become baggy in the knees and backside and these didn't do that. i usually wear an 8/10 and i purchased a medium and they fit well. i would say that run a little big though.,8

195,37,"Pretty on the hanger, weird on me","I tried this on in a store and it was beautiful except the sizing was way off. i'm 5'11"" and usually a 12 or 14. the 12 was skin-tight and the 14 was so loose it was comical - and even on my super long legs, the cuffs dragged on the floor. plus the lacy panels in the cleavage area are totally see-through and my bra was very visible. i was totally bummed. also incidentally, this didn't seem the best quality. there were strings hanging out of the lacy areas, and the waist tie ties way higher than",0
195,37,Super cute. pockets would be nice,,2
195,38,Not worth the $$,"I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however, the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally, at 5'8, 130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.",17
195,38,Perfect pants,I'm so in love with these pants. they are so flattering and made of thick material. they do run a bit large though so i'd suggest you size down. i also like they they're high waisted. the gold button details are gorgeous as well. great pair of pants.,1
195,38,,"I love, love this wide leg pants! they feel beautiful on and fit like a glove. i do think they run a bit small in the waist, because they were a bit too tight in my regular size. typically, cloths are a little too large in the waist on me (i have a curvy/athletic figure). as other reviewers stated, they pants are long, but they are great length for wedges. otherwise, i would recommend having the length tailored.",0

195,39,Showstopper,"I wore these pants for the first time yesterday to two parties. before anyone asked for my name, they complimented me on the pants. my husband loved it, my friends loved it, and people i didn't know loved it. it's worth every penny i paid for it. i bought these pant to bring on my trip to italy later this summer.",8
195,39,Super cute and fitted,"I tried this one without a bra, and t was fine... a little droopy but i could go without.
the things that bothered me: the pattern wasn't even on both sides, so where the seem is on the legs by the wait, didn't match... some people may not be annoyed by that, but hard for me not to look at.

195,41,Unique and flattering,"The fabric and design of this piece are so unique.  i am skeptical of wide leg designs in product photos because the fabric is often much more voluminous irl than it appears, which is the case for this jumpsuit.  despite the extra volume, the fabric weight gives it a structured look which makes the wide legs look fantastic on.  there is a silicon grip band around the top that allows you to wear it strapless, though it doesn't seem very functional to me without boning or more structure to the sid",0

195,41,,I love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark. the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf. i think they make the leg look stunted. the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw. it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed.,16

195,45,Unhappy with purchase,I ordered this pants in white and black. i read the reviews and weren't that bad. i am 5'6 and 125 lbs. i got them in size small. they are way too big. the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe 5'8 or 5'9. i have to returned them. quality is ok looking on my opinion.,0

195,53,Finally--pants for real women!,"These are the best trousers i have bought in a long time! i'm 5'8 and 145 pounds and the 8 fit with a bit of extra room in the waist--not enough to size down. i love that they are not ""skinny""--so over the skinny fit. i plan to wear these with black heels, white tee, and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same time--oh, and a statement necklace--always a statement necklace. these are a must for every fall wardrobe! more pants like these, please!",3

195,64,Adorable,"A sales associate found this for me at my local retailer. i probably would have never thought to try it on. i am 5'1'' and normally a size 8 or a medium. the size small was still too large, so i ordered a size small petite. it fits perfectly, looks adorable on, and is so comfortable. i can't wait for the warm weather to wear it!",0

196,33,Had high hopes!,"I had sized down because i'm usually a petite, but didn't have the option for petite here, and it was still too big. a petite or an additional size down could have helped the fit, but in the end the style wasn't what i was going for. the dress has a little more texture going on than what is revealed in the photo here on the site -- i thought it was a luxurious brocade fabric, but the shininess actually comes from silky threads on a mesh-ish overlay. it's a lovely, quality dress, and the color is",8

overall, i love this dress and will be keeping it.",6
196,45,So comfy...so sad it didnt fit,The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.,0

196,69,So pretty,"I ordered this dress to wear to a summer wedding in san francisco. i liked that it had sleeves, a plus. when i was trying it on, i found that it was a little snug, then realized it was the slip, which is not too tight at all once the dress is on. it helps to smooth those little bumps. it is drop waist style, which skims the torso, then flares out prettily. all in all very complimentary, beautiful color, well made. very pleased; it will be comfortable and perfect at the wedding.",2

201,27,Product great for a tall person,"I love the concept of an airy, flowing sweater that has great detail. this item stole my heart online. however, i am fairly petite (5'3'') and it looked like it was drowning me. the neck line is decently wide and my small frame couldn't hold it up; it kept falling off my shoulders. i ended up returning. i think it would look and feel fantastic though if i were taller and had broad shoulders.",0
201,28,Love this top,"I have received so many compliments on this top from both men and women. it is so comfortable and cute, i never want to take it off. :p",0
201,28,Truly retailer,"This. this you have to buy! i just tried it on in our new store the other night and am in love. gorgeous details went into the sweater coat. it's thinner than most, which is nice when you want to look lovely but don't quite need to bundle up! i plan on purchasing after christmas if it's still around!",0
201,28,Way too big!,"I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment, it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.",0
201,30,Beautiful piece,,0
201,30,Super cozy,This is a steal at the sale price. medium is large on me and i'm generally a large at retailer. so soft.,0
201,30,Super cute,"I ordered this a few weeks ago on major sale. im quite tall (5'11) so i went with the m/l to ensure that the length would work. its definitely long enough, almost a little too big, but i like the slouchy look. my only real complaint is that its a bit itchy. other than that i think its a great buy!",1
201,31,Make sure you handwash or dry clean only,"Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash, but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.",2
201,32,Shorter than expected,I ordered this in hopes of wearing as a tunic with leggings for my rehearsal dinner. it is much shorter than expected and wouldn't have looked right with leggings. it also was more gray than ivory and in the short time i had it on was shedding lint like crazy. beautiful in photos but didn't work for me.,0
201,33,Beautiful!,This is very unique and stylish! the embroidery is stunning plus it is extremely comfortable. it is pretty warm. it does not itch me at all as others have noted.,0
201,33,Gorgeous!!,"This is a very ""retailer "" piece. i love it! i wish retailer would bring back more pieces like this! anyway, the details on this sweater are so special! the sweater is sturdier and warmer than i thought it would be which is a plus. i love the drape it has to it down the front. one slight dislike is that the shoulders seem a little tight in my usual small. but, considering this sweater is completely sold out i will make it work! love it!",0
201,33,,"Cute and comfortable. not sure i'd say it's worth the full price as it's not a very heavy jacket. it did suit my needs though and was otherwise what i was looking for, so i kept it and have enjoyed wearing it.",6
201,33,,"I like the idea of the pullover. the quality of is nice; the material is very soft and feels pleasant to the touch.

i expected this sweater to be more flattering though. it is true to size, but the length is strange. it seems a bit too long, yet is too short to look like a longer tunic. or maybe the waistline is a little low... whatever it is, it makes me look like i have short legs.

also, the collar won't stay down, the way it is shown in the picture. but it may work better for someone wi",7
201,34,Favorite sweater,"I just received this sweater last week and love it. the material is so much softer and lighter than i expected, but plenty warm. the neck is slightly itchy, but not bad at all. i wore this sweater to church over a navy dress on sunday and received tons of compliments. it is such a unique piece.",0
201,35,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this coat, but it was a miss for me. while the wool is soft and not itchy, the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy.  also, the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located.  i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was, but alas, i just could not get over the poor tailoring.  for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs) and it was big.",0
201,35,Unexpectedly love it!,This vest is great. i'm wearing with my red striped turtleneck dress i got on sale here. i can see this going with so many outfits. mainly those dresses that might feel a little tight around butt and hip area- this will cover it all. worth full price imo. tts. i'm a 10 and this in m is perfect.,0
201,36,Even better in person,"I am pleasantly surprised by this purchase. i went back and forth on buy-in this, but ended up trying it out. so glad i did! it is very flattering and a very nice color. it fits perfectly and i look forward to wearing it with my distressed denim and boots for fall.",2
201,36,Pockets not well executed,"I'm a vest lover of all shapes, lengths and styles so i had big plans for this vest.  in the end, the pockets ended up ruining the lay and line of this vest.  they are too bulky and end up pulling at the front of the vest, drawing your eye to the pockets and not the neckline.  i agree with previous reviews that it could be worn into spring- i wouldn't wear it in summer.  the fit is loose, i thought the medium arm holes were large for my frame- 5'8"" 140#.  overall i sent it back.",0
201,36,Soft and substantial,"I'm 5'5"" 120 lbs and bought this in size medium because i have long arms and was afraid that the cashmere would shrink even if i hand-wash and dry flat (because let's be honest--i doubt i'll ever send it to the dry cleaner). it's loose through the body and arms, but the sleeves are the perfect length. the term ""bell sleeve"" is no exaggeration. the sleeves are billowy and voluminous and i can see them getting in the way while washing my hands or doing dishes. i guess i will have to reserve this s",6
201,37,Classic retailer,"This screams the old school classic retailer that we all love. it was one of my rare full price purchases because it's just perfection! i'm 5'4, 112lbs and normally and xs. however, when i tried on an xs is store i felt that it sort of swallowed me up. i went ahead and ordered an xs petite even though i rarely go with petites, but it fits perfectly. it doesn't leave room for layering, but i live in socal, so i don't need to layer often.",0
201,37,It's a keep,,0
201,37,Nice piece,"Ordered online, hedging my bets on size (chose xs/s) because i have broad shoulders and muscular arms and wear anything from 2-8 sizes depending on brand. my gamble paid off - it&#39;s a beautiful sweater. soft, comfortable, nice drape.

(i suspect that finer-boned more petite customers might complain of swimming in this, but it worked well for me!)",0
201,37,Timeless top (but try on first),"I'm thrilled with this purchase, and looking forward to spending many years with this classic. on the subject of fit; i generally wear size medium for tops, but my broad shoulders occasionally have me in larges. since the thick-textured fabric is mostly cotton and minimal stretch (with a mix of linen), the larger size will provide more room and comfort. i'm honoring my ""tts"" choice for folks who prefer a more ""fitted"" look. overall this piece wears well!!",7
201,37,,"Love the look of this poncho - which is not as large/billowy as i thought it would be. i tried it on as a whim in the store and fell in love. the colors are more beige than gray, for those of you with pale/blue underdone complexions. it may wash you out. love the orange knit running through to give it a little pop. i'm 5'9""/132 pounds, and the hem was a bit cropped on me. may want to consider a tank top or t-shirt underneath.",0

201,38,Runs small; also very fitted,"I'm a size xl and i'm busty, so my review might not apply to everyone.
.
i really wanted this jacket to work, however, it did not. i tried this jacket on in my usual size xl and it was nowhere near the correct size. this jacket runs small. i don't see how anyone with a bust is going to be able to button this jacket. the jacket is not lined and it is very fitted, so putting the jacket on and taking it off will require a very thin shirt to be worn underneath.

201,38,Soft but a bit maternity,"The blue is a beautiful color, rather unique and it is really soft being cashmere. although, for the price i do feel it should of been a bit more ""special"". i also feel it's loose lower half feels a bit maternity. all that being said i do like the overall sweater and am keeping it as the color and feel win.",8

201,39,*another* grey cardigan? oh yes...,"I have too many grey cardigans. i also have a lot of oversized cardis. but i had to have this one because the stitch pattern is so nice and the yarns are so soft and snuggly. how could i resist? the weave is a bit open work but it still keeps me warm & happy. it also lays in a way that doesn't make me look bulky and top heavy, which my body type already is. i feel sorry for the first reviewer who kept getting subpar sweaters. mine arrived brand new in factory cellophane. i would advise that this",0
201,39,A tad scratchier than most,,0
201,39,Perfect for fall!,"This is the kind of weather i want to wrap myself up with a cozy and soft blanket. but i can't really walking around with a giant bulky blanket. this cardigan is as good as i can get. it's so soft, comfy and well made. nowadays most of the knitwear are made of dominantly polyester. this one is mostly natural material with has a much better feel than the man made kind.
i like how this garment is not too bulky and not too tight. warm enough for the breeze but not too thick. love it!",2
201,39,,Love this beautiful sweater! it's become one of my wardrobe staples. it's got a great cut and i love the design.,0
201,39,,"Soft knit, perfectly finished, comfortable and looks great on the model and the previous reviewers' mom.  it just looks too 'empty-nester' for my style (and i won't be until 2035!)  this is a nice base for a creative dresser/accessorizer, which i'm not.  i'm also messy so it's hard to keep ivory clothing coffee free.  i'm glad i tried it on because it proves how great a label knitted & knotted is for quality garments.  just had to pass on this for personal style reasons.",2

201,40,Better in person than the photos,"Like another reviewer, i was in the store looking for the vest with the faux fur collar and tie-waist. it turned out to be too long/bulky for my small frame, or there wasn't an xs (can't recall), but i saw this and it's just the thing i didn't even know i needed. i'm fairly thin and petite at 5'4 and drown in most cardigans. this is just long enough. it was a subtle a-line shape. fabric is not thick but is substantial enough that it's still warm. i also like that it's hand washable, nice to have",1
201,40,It is weird but at the same time unique,"This top does sit weird, feels like a circus outfit... but at the same time its unique in its own way. i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down, probably because of the way this top is styled. i'm 6ft tall 160 lbs i have curvy body and small chest 34a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway. material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton.",0
201,41,Beautiful sweater and so much better in person!,"Just purchased this sweater in store as a christmas present for my self and i'm in love! i feel the fit besides the shoulders which are somewhat narrow, is perfect. i usually wear a petite medium in everything but had to go with the regular small because they didn't have petites in the store. i tried on the regular medium and it was just slightly too big everywhere. overall i am so pleased with this purchase. so happy i popped into retailer today and saw it!",0
201,41,"Beautiful, soft and cozy","As one would expect from boucle, this sweater is incredibly soft, warm and cozy without being heavy. i fell in love with it when i first saw it and got it in white color. it's beautiful, goes with casual and work clothing (belt helps with the latter styling), and it didn't leave lint on the dark skirt i wore with it to work! i usually wear xs or s and found this sweater to be still roomy in xs, with sleeves being a bit long. i hope it won't stretch with wear as boucles sometimes do - that's my o",3

201,41,Soft and cozy,"This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size, though a bit boxy, so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side, but i'm petite, so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear, but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased",2
201,42,Chunky cashmere,"I bough a green, size s (140lbs., 34b, 5'8). the sweater is true to size: it hits at my low hip and, although it is cut generously, it is cut close to the body. the ""green"" color is very pretty and true to the monitor depiction of a bright turquoise. the material is very soft and definitely high-quality cashmere with no itch factor. however, the knit of the yarn is very chunky, which means that this is not a slimming garment. moreover, since i have long arms, the bell sleeves do not reach my wri",11

201,46,Awkward and large fit,"I was so excited to order this beautiful coat.  it does seem well made and is very soft.  unfortunately, the fit is completely off and is overall large.  i ordered a small, as this coat appears slightly more snug on top, a-line on the bottom, with three buttons.  i am 5'6"" and weigh approximately 145.  i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming.  instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared.  the  pleat on the back is unflattering.  sadly going back.",0
201,46,Could have been one of the great ones,"I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous, the pattern unusual, it is soft and warm, and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big, making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.",49
201,46,Practical professor,"I ordered this in two sizes and have only received one so far, but i think i really like it. that said, the one i got weirdly has pockets not shown in the images, which makes it seems more professorial than i'd prefer, partly because i am a professor and don't want to dress like one if i can help it. that said, i really need a floppy, easy cardigan, and this might well be it.",2

201,59,Inspired,"I am inspired to sit in front of a roaring fire, sipping tea, with the dogs at my feet, in this sweater. or roaming the moors. the cashmere is thick, luxurious, and soft. there is a cable detail that runs along the large wooden buttons and also the pockets, (decent sized pockets to stash a hanky, while roaming the moors). the fit is on the large size and boxy. if i had to nit pick, i would say that the length could be a tad longer. the sweater does not have complete derriã¨re coverage. i am 5?5?",3
201,59,Not worth the money,I did not like this cashmere sweater at all. i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color. although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40% off.,4
201,59,Super cute sweater coat.,This is a go with everything throw on sweater coat that is very soft and flattering on. the fit is true to size for a swing coat. being a heather black helps with the no show of lint. i will wear this no doubt for years to come. thanks retailer.!!!,1
201,59,Warm & cozy!,This sweater is thicker than some of the other cashmere sweaters i purchased at retailer this year. it is made with high quality cashmere as it is extremely soft. i wouldn't describe it as chunky or bulky though. it's probably made of at least 2 or maybe even 3 ply cashmere. the sleeves do run slightly short. i purchased the xs and it fits my petite frame perfectly! grab it while you can! it's so luxurious & super warm for the winter.,1

201,62,Must try on,"This vest is so cute and flattering. these pictures don't do it justice. you must see it in person and try it on. it only has a small percentage of wool in it, so it could easily be worn in the spring/summer with a tank.",3

201,64,Very nice,"I saw this online & wondered abt the sleeve length on me. i was thinking about ordering the petite size since i'm only 5'3"". sometimes cardigans have longer sleeves than i want. it was at the local store so i tried on the regular xs in the grey. the fit & sleeve length was fine. what i didn't care for was a slight itchiness (wool fiber) & some mild shedding (alpaca fiber). i decided against it but it is nice looking. 5""3"", 117#",22
201,65,This is a wow!!!,Went to the local store today for something else and left with this in the cream color. it is just simply awesome. i could have worn the s but felt that the m would be a little better. i'm between a s and m most of the time. can't say enough good things about the quality and versatility of this sweater. great piece for cooler summer nights and for a cover up for pilates/yoga. can't wait to wear it and now i'm tempted by the teal.,2
201,66,Foret cardigan,"Love,love, love this. it is so different and unique. definitely not something you will see in any other store. wore it last week and have never received so many compliments on one piece. so retailer!!!!!! it was very warm and comfortable. i did wear a turtleneck under this, because of reviews of itching. i did not have any problems.",0
201,66,Great royal blue color,"I immediately loved the rich royal blue color of this sweater with its pretty flower, nice fabric and medium weight. nice warm sweater.i have an retailer skirt just like the photo, great outfit. i am happy i ordered it, but hope it shrinks after washing.the small is very big and boxy, sleeves long. i am 5'6 medium build. small usually fits me well.
i recommend downsizing or you will probably take this back.",0
201,67,Beautiful sweater,"The design and colors on this sweater arguably make it a ""statement sweater"". it has a modified raglan type sleeve. i found the sleeves to fit just fine. for reference, i am 5'9"", 150 lbs., 34dddd, and the medium fit perfectly. it is not a long sweater and, with my height, i wear a long tank top or cami underneath. i love the way it looks.",0
201,68,"Cozy, great for autumn & mild winter, nice shape",,2
201,68,Weird,"When i tried this top on, i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton, which, instead of falling by the hips, juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea, wrong material and placement.",5

202,23,Cozy soft,This sweater is buttery soft and warm. it is long and you will want every color. i bought the sky blue and it looks fabulous with so many outfits. i had to get the gray color also. the sleeves are a soft fitted rib material and the body is long and roomy. love love!,1
202,23,The one that didn't get away! :),"You know when you're shopping and you don't buy something you like, but later you can't stop thinking about it? that was the case with his sweater! i saw it paired with a cute top in the store so i tried it on on a whim. i'm so glad i eventually got it! it's toasty, soft, and thick with the perfect amount of quirk.",0
202,26,Lounge chic,I loved the contrast of the front panels and sleeves/back of this sweater. it has a coat look with the ease of a sweater. the arms seem very long and i wish i went with an xs as where i live not much laying is needed. but overall this is a lovely sweater!,0
202,26,Loved it on the model...,"I want to be the person who lounges like the model...but this was huge and more wool-feeling than the lightweight shawl i was hoping for. i am an 8, got the xs/s it was the right size....i returned it.",1
202,26,No closure,"The sweater is very very warm. it looks okay, not the best but not bad. i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure, i don't wear sweaters and jackets without closures. i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder. so i am sending it back.",1
202,29,Great purchase,"I originally bought this in a petite xs. i am 5' 4"" tall on a good day. sometimes longer sweaters can overwhelm me. but the petite was almost a bit snug and short in the arms. i exchanged it for a regular xs and while i now have to cuff the sleeves, the overall look is much better. i bought the gray but really liked the blue and moss too. will be very nice for the frigid days we have in ohio. looks great with leggings tucked into boots i think. a winner!",2
202,30,Luxurious,"This reminds me of a kimono or poncho rather than a ""cardigan"" but that aside its a beautiful sweater. the feel of it is luxurious and is soft and comfortable. i would size down at least one size. i'm usually a medium to large and i bought the small. i gave this piece 4 stars because it is a touch boxy. it's seems like a piece i'll throw on with jeans and wear to a casual dinner in the fall. definitely a fall/winter item.",3
202,31,Love this beautiful stylish sweater wrap,"I am a frequent retailer shopper who has found many items to be hit or miss. this one's a definite hit:) i absolutely love the vibe of this sweater wrap (unique, bohemian, feminine, cozy), the fabric (beautiful intricate weave, high quality knit, wearable virtually year-round thanks to air conditioning), how stylish it is (fringe, very ""in"" kimono cocoon cardigan), how much of my wardrobe it goes with (neutral ivory color that can be dressed up or down, elegant or casual), and the fact that it has",1

202,33,Soft and thick without the bulk,"I got so many compliments on this the first day i wore it. i think of this more like a sweater coat than a regular sweater. it is extremely soft and warm, but not bulky at all. it lays really neatly, which is why i think of it more like a coat. this will definitely be a staple moving into the winter and then into spring. keep in mind though that this does not button - they're just for show.",0
202,34,Soft and cozy,"So soft, warm, and comfy! the colors are absolutely beautiful and represented accurately in the photo. i went with a small based on other reviews, and while it fits, it is slightly big. i probably could have sized down for a more tailored look but i like the extra room and think it still drapes well without looking bulky. for reference i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs (33-25-33) and mostly wear an xs/2 in tops. it does shed which is not a big deal to me but might be a deal breaker for others so i thought i woul",0

202,39,Like it alright,"I like this sweater but i'm not in love. the rib knit on the sleeves are too form fitting (not restrictive) on my chubby arms so it doesn't look flattering when i wear long sleeves. i do appreciate the mixed patterns and the soft moss colorway, it's very pretty together. i purchased the medium petite and the length looks good. maybe i need the large because of my body type. i'll give it another chance when my paquerette gets here",0

202,40,Love it!,"This is an amazing sweater. thick but not overly thick, the material is beautiful and the colors rich, i love the collar and the way it closes as well as the pockets and the back being different from the front. i hope it washes well. i bought the moss. it fits nicely and is very slimming. i highly recommend.",0
202,43,I love this sweater!,Thus sweater is perfect. the fit is exactly as i expected it from other reviews. it is super soft and not at all itchy. i have worn it over a tank top with jeans and boots as well as to work over a dress. the fact that i can wash it is an added bonus. i haven't dried it yet as i am worried it could shrink. i bought this with a discount but it is totally worth full price.,1
202,43,Love the pattern and color,"I love this sweater but i'm on the fence about keeping it only because i haven't figured out a way to layer and wear it. it really does appear best with a plain white top and jeans. i've tried it with several other things in my closet and just haven't found another combination that sells it for me - i really like my pieces to be more versatile so i can mix and match them into other outfits. this piece is just enough of a ""statement"" that - for me - wearing it with more simple clothing staples is",0

202,46,Runs very large,"I instantly fell in love with the graphic pattern on this drapey layering piece, and i've received compliments every time i have worn it. however i seriously considered returning it because the way the garment is cut causes it to bunch awkwardly at the sides. maybe it's still just too big--even though medium or large is my size in tops, the medium in this sweater clearly looks baggier on me than it does on the model in the photo, for instance. it is definitely not slimming, but the striking patt",0
202,47,Nice and cozy,"I love sweaters like this. it's perfect over a tank top for a casual every day look. it's soft, comfy, and i love the length. one more thing i like is that while it looks great just open, there is a snap to fasten it if you want to.",4
202,48,Cute sweater coat,This sweater coat is really cute and soft (i hate itchy sweaters). the blue is lovely and the cut is flattering. i'm going to check it out in other colors as well!,4
202,49,Perfect fall piece,This is a gorgeous jacket! love the softness and the style is unique and fresh. the color is going to keep me cheered through the winter. this will look great with a scarf and leggings.,1
202,52,Cute sweater,"Overall i like this sweater, but it does have a couple flaws. the sweater looks better snapped. unfortunately it only has one snap on the front--there should be another one inside. after a couple wears, my snap started to come loose, probably because it pulls so much. the sweater is a bit oversized and i probably ordered the wrong size. i'm 5'7"" and 140 lbs. i ordered a medium, should have ordered a small. all that being said, i still love the look and color (moss green) of the sweater and would",0

202,62,"Great quality, but odd fit","When i saw this, i ordered immediately thinking it was similar to the popular colorblocked stripe sweater from last year. the knit is stretchy and textured and feels like great quality (would wash well), but it's pretty lightweight. the fit is huge...could easily size down. i'm 5'7"" 128# and found the small to be loose everywhere, including the arms. the length was at my knees, and the stripe fell awkwardly across my chest. no idea what i'd wear this with even if it fit better. sadly, it's going",1

202,68,"Cozy, warm, great details","I purchased this sweater after i saw it on a salesclerk at my local retailer store. i am usually a xs but based on reviews decided to size up considering the description of the fit of arms. when it arrived it was overall ok but seemed boxy at sides so i exchanged for my usual size. it arrived today and fits great-less fabric along sides but still good length for my 5'8, slender frame. the arms and shoulders are not too snug. the colors are beautiful and it is out of the ordinary-a statement piece,",1

203,20,Lovely light jacket,"I had to size up to a medium because otherwise my boobs would not get along well with that button down front, but once that was taken care of i really loved the silhouette this created. the belted waist flatters an hourglass shape nicely. perfect for sipping tea and eating finger pastries like a fancy little lady. i have no idea what i'm going to do when the time comes to wash it though... we'll cross that road when we come to it, i guess. also - the interior seams are a bright, electric blue -",1
203,25,"Beautiful design, poor execution","I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen, but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.

at first glance, i knew i wouldn't be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy, single layer of unlined, unstructured fabric, to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt, i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim",4
203,27,Disappointed,"I had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email, and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself. i was very excited to get it, as it is a beautiful coat online. however, once i received it i was very disappointed. the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $168, and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with. i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well.

203,28,Cannot wait for spring!,I saw this trench in an email a couple weeks back and instantly fell in love. i bought it for myself for my birthday and got it just the other day and it is just as beautiful in person as it is online. fits true to size and is so flattering. i love the true navy color and cannot wait to wear this on cool spring nights!!,1
203,30,Perfect trench,"Can't say enough about the style of this trench, the material is soft and the shape is amazing for all body types. the color is great and there's some pretty aqua colored piping in the inside of the coat.

the sizing is a little hmmm. i ordered a large. i'm usually a 12 on top or a large, mostly to accommodate a larger chest (ddd i think). proportion wise i'm more a medium through the shoulders and in length, so sometimes i can size down to a medium or large petite depending on the shape.

203,34,Not for busty gals,"I'm usually a 12, or size l in retailer and when i tried this on, buttoning it up from the bottom, i was so excited...until i reached the chest. it was way too tight in the bust and i am not that big in that area - it was painfully tight on my 38d chest. it's also unlined, which makes it not very useful for anything other than the warmest times of year. it's a shame because the skirt is swishy, and a good length - many trenches are too short, or not wide enough on the bottom for a fuller figure. i",2
203,34,Worth it for me,"I rarely write reviews on here, but this coat deserves a mention.

203,35,Must be tall & lean,"I wanted to love this coat so bad. the material is lovely and it's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off. if you have any hips forget it (my hips are 38"")- you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy. the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders....like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted, it was weird. but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn't a size thing. i bought a size medium, at 5'5"" and 140 pounds.",0
203,35,Perfect for fall,"I got this coat because i needed something black and thought the plaid was black. it's not -- but that's my fault and i love it anyway! it's perfect for our temperate seattle fall and winter -- not too light, not too heavy. i get a ton of compliments! i'm 5'9"" and about 145, and a medium fits perfectly.",0

203,38,Non-stuffy trench,"This trench coat solves my eternal problem with trench coats - which is that when i see one on a model in an ad they look effortless and casual, but then when i try one on it looks rigid and stuffy somehow. this trench coat drapes beautifully. that said, it's not the same kind of fabric as a traditional trench coat so it probably isn't water resistant. i'm fine with that, it looks amazing.",0

203,51,,I agree with the other reviews that the sleeves can be tight even for those with slim arms. life would be great in this coat if my arms were always down by my sides. but when i lift my arms that's another story. i also agree that the material wrinkles easily. this is a high-maintenance item as far as pressing and ironing goes. it is a very pretty feminine coat but i would reconsider this only if it goes on sale.,3

it is more fitted than last years style.",2

204,32,Great unique everyday tee made in the usa!,"Based on the first person's review, i ordered a l at first... then i got it and it kinda fit like a maternity shirt and looked a bit too baggy/sloppy, not as flattering as the picture. i tried using the measurement guide below, based on the bust measurement, and i'm at the low end of the m size, so i ended up ordering the m and s just in case. the s size fit like the picture. i'm glad this isn't slim in the waist and fitted nicely in the shoulders. the blue color is beautiful. if you are more of",4
204,32,Like a tent,"I ordered my usually size, xs, and it's just so wide and unflattering. looks like i'm wearing a tent. i don't understand why tops anymore are either huge or skin tight. why not something in between?!  the pink color is really pretty and the details are nice but it's just blah in terms of the fit.",0
204,32,Love the bow!,"Just a cute, casual tee that i grabbed on sale, but i love the bow in the back! something unique for an otherwise plain tee!",2
204,33,Comfy staple,Love this top! bought the navy to be a cool matching momma for my kiddos baseball and loved it! bought the light pink and red too! fun off the shoulder tee... love how long it is in the back... one thing i will say is that one of the colors fits slightly different like the hem isn't symmetrical or something so i find myself readjusting but i'm sure i'm the only one who notices it... and it doesn't keep me from wearing it and loving it!!!,0
204,33,"Flattering, beautiful autumn top","I have this color also in the grey - flattering, interesting shirt. i have think hips but a fuller waist, the vertical lines of this shirt design suggest otherwise. great to pair with torn up skinny jeans! love the petite line now in portland.",0
204,33,Good tee but not the same as past version,"Loved the version of this loc top that retailer carried two years ago (or was it three?). was thrilled to see what looked like the same top and was called the same name ... but it's just not the same. length is too short, body is too wide, and even the fabric seems to be lower quality. disappointing, but i still bought more than one color.",0
204,33,Great color and drape,"This cardigan's color is great. it goes with a lot of items surprisingly. the fit is a little large/loose, but that's nice for being able to wear various shirts underneath. i've received lots of compliments on it.",0

204,33,Great tee,"I bought this top on sale in the store and immediately came home and ordered it in another color online. i love the length even in the xs which isn't always the case. i am 5'9"" and a size 2 and the xs fits me perfect even after washing and drying a couple times. looks cute under sweaters and vests. can wear all year round. lightweight and good neckline.",0
204,33,Love the color,"This shirt is perfect. hangs nicely, and i love the little longer sleeves.

beautiful color too!",1
204,33,Not for me... and not at this price,"I thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe, and while the color didn't disappoint, everything else did. it's a very loose slub so it's very see through and thin, i'd have to wear a cami under it. also the tie front has a very high slit! like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt. i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga/ gym wear, but definitely not at this price. pass for me sadly...",3
204,33,The back is my favorite,Love the lace on the back! it's a sweet take on a typical tee! comfy! a little on the boxier side but a great tee.,0
204,34,Cut top,This top was really cute but the side slits were just a little to high for my taste. maybe a size up would have worked better.,2

204,34,Not tts,"Based on the other reviews, i ordered a l and xl even though i would normally order a m. the l fits like a slightly fitted m without being too tight; the xl, of course, is a little larger, but not like a typical xl, certainly not sloppy-looking or oversized. the material is soft and the dark blue is lovely. i will be keeping both sizes. i would most likely not have been happy with a m.",3
204,34,So boxy!,"I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.",0

204,35,"Strange sizing, but fabulous color","The fit is a bit loose in the body (more than you can tell on the model) - more like a true swing style top. i feel the arms are a good fit, but i ordered one size up from my normal since i'm planning to wear this as a maternity top. arms are definitely a size smaller than the body. the ruffles at the bottom are a bit odd, but overall i still like it. the cutout notch at the collar is super cute! plus, the green color of this top is lovely and i love that it's made in the usa so i'll be keeping",2
204,35,"Wonderful fit, flattering, easy care tee","I purchased all the colors of this wonderful tee after receiving the first. it's machine wash and dry, and they've all held up well through multiple washes so far. the neckline and fit is flattering for a larger bust, due to the ribbing, but would be great on a more athletic figure as well. the fabric is soft enough that the 3/4 sleeves don't bug me, like some other tops do. all the colors are great and you'll want more than one! true to size.",15

204,36,"A great, classic t-shirt with flare","I was looking for a classic, white t-shirt that wasn't too big (i.e. a tunic) or too fitted. this was perfect! i love the irregular hemline and the fit. it's not too tight, but not too big either where it looks messy. just a perfect little tee for any wardrobe. runs true to size. i'm a 34d, size 10 and ordered the medium - it fit great!",3
204,36,Adorable!!,,0
204,36,Fun top,"Just the perfect weight for summer wear. falls gently over tummy without being too long and the ruffled edge and quirky uneven length make it just interesting enough to make it feel like more than just a tee shirt. i got it in black and re-ordered in pale blue and am hoping the lighter color is not ""see-through."" this is a nice buy on sale and can be dressed up or casual. it feels and wears great but i have not washed it so gave it a good on quality. if it washes well then an excellent would be",0

204,39,Great idea poor execution,I love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasn't so flattering on. such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee!,30

204,39,"Noce yellow, but so thin","I like the cut and look of this shirt, and tried on the xs (fits 115 lbs, 30ss chest), but i find that the t-shirts lately are kind of thin and see through... the shirt is fun, and the color is adorable, but had to pass as i could see my bra too clearly for my liking.",2

204,40,Great basic - bought all 3 colors,"Great top! i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s. i ordered the white to start with and decided to go back for the other 2 colors. it's a great basic to wear with pants/shorts/skirts, but the side slit and slant set it apart from a regular tank. i opted for the small in this top just because of where the side slit hit.",1
204,40,Not sure...,"I was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand, but i'm a little unsure. the front part hangs a bit too low on my 5'4"" frame, yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides. i'm just not sure it hangs right on me. it's fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely, and looks great with the front loosely tucked. just not what i was expecting.",0
204,40,Stylish tee,"This tee is so comfortable and stylish. you can easily dress it up. i love how the back covers your assets, and the sleeves are long enough for tall girls. a great buy on sale! i bought a small and bought 3 colors!",0

204,44,Big flowy tee,I wanted to love this shirt but it quickly lost shape and a hole was created in the middle of the shirt after just a few washes. not worth the price. poorly made. you need to wear a shirt underneath bc it is so thin. the shirt looks better int he picture. i like it but it wears terribly.,0
204,44,It's ok,The fabric is great quality but it stretches too much around the waist making it look a little awkward. other than that the quality is good.,0
204,44,Love!,"I love wearing this so much! i wear it with leggings, jeans and i also like to pair it with is a long linen skirt that i have. i purchased it in plum and then went back for a second in moss. i got them before they went on sale for fear they'd be out of my size. i am very happy with my purchase! i highly recommend.",0
204,44,"Nice t, but not super soft","This shirt has beautiful coloring but the material wasn't as soft as i thought it would be. i was hoping they would be the super soft material, maybe washing them would help, but i didn't want to chance it so i returned them.",0
204,44,Way too large everywhere,"I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves, but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall, it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.",0
204,45,Another great one from left of center,"Love this top! such a pretty color and so comfy. sleeves are a bit long, but fits pretty true, like most left of center. washes and dries in the dryer very nicely.",0

204,45,"Versatile, everyday tee---dress up or dress down.","Though i am a true size medium, i do not like fitted tees, so generally i buy a large. based upon other reviews, i decided to give the medium a try, hoping that it would be loose enough. though i am on the cusp of petite (5' 3 1/2""), i decided to go with the regular medium since i prefer longer, tunic length tops. the medium does run big, imo, and fits me like a large would. it is loose, flowy and long enough to cover my entire backside. the sleeves are long and i do have to roll them up, perhap",0

204,46,Love this shirt!,This shirt fits great. it is a fun look. i wore it wear a pair of leggings and sneakers for a casual day look. it goes down to my knees in the back and the front is asymmetric. so cute. i think i will get a lot of use out of this going forward.,2
204,46,Not in love with the color,Ordered this online and thought it was more of a red than the true orange that it is,0
204,46,"Perfect fit, casual, comfy",The slubbed palette tee fits perfectly. it's very comfortable and looks cute with jeans. i'll be ordering more in other colors. i really like that its made in the us too.,1
204,46,Perfect long-sleeved tee,I ordered the orange version in size xl. it fits true to size. the fit on me matches the online photos. it's so comfortable to wear. i love the unique details of it. i've washed & air-dried it too. it retained its size. the color is outstanding. it's such a pretty shade that looks more red online than it does in person. there's more of a darker orange tint to it. i've gotten a lot of use out of this tee. hopefully it'll come back in the fall in more colors.,0
204,46,Runs huge!,"I am normally a medium and i would take an xs in this top - i actually tried a m, s and xs and the xs fit but was still big. yes, this is supposed to be a loose draped piece, but for me, i didn't want it to make me look like i was huge through the waist line. the red is really pretty, the white is see thru.",1
204,46,Sloppy looking but pretty colors,"I ordered this style in the blue, red, yellow and white for the sale price. they all fit true to size, matching the model's photos. but, the quality is poor. the hems are frayed, they wrinkle easily, they're just a mess. the model's photos show a messy look so you know what you're getting. the positives are the colors. the blue is especially gorgeous. the yellow is like a spicy mustard shade. they are all comfortable. just sloppy looking. the sale price matches the quality. they do stretch out t",1
204,47,Material too filmsy,"I am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss. it is too boxy (short) and the material is very thin for the price. i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer. for reference, i am 5'4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small. bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store.",4

204,48,"Flattering & comfortable, a bit flow at bottom","I got this in black, size medium, my usual size. i am fairly ""curvy"" on top and found the shape in that area very flattering to my figure. it is shown as being rather drapey in front and indeed it does fit rather large at the bottom & indeed through the body itself. since i'm slim there, i will have to tailor it, am used to this considering i have to buy to fit my chest. but i'm keeping it for sure as i love the fabric and i think it will become a staple of my wardrobe. good job retailer!",1
204,48,,"The ruffle is a sweet detail on what might be an otherwise basic, rather boxy shirt. it is a nice weight and drape, but please know it is a bit short and square. i love the asymmetrical ruffle, however, and think it makes this tee worth it.",46
204,49,"Simple top, love the shape","I actually love the fit of this t. the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit - but i love that it has more of a flared shape. the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate, it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t, and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape.",0

204,63,A whole closet of this shirt,"All the positive reviews are right - the shirt is great! something not entirely obvious from the online photos is that there is a slit on both sides of the shirt. makes it even more comfortable and flattering. i wasn't sure how i was going to style this for the winter before i received it but as soon as i put it on i had plenty of ideas. it looks particularly great with a chunky scarf, leggings, and boots. it looked great with a close fitting turtleneck underneath. it really can be dressed up or",0
204,63,Not exactly what i expected.,"I ordered this top in 2 colors because i thought it would be great with leggings. i always love my retailer purchases, but this fell a little short. i think it may be the type fabric it is, but the way the back hangs so low on my frame (5'4"") it doesn't drape nicely over my leggings. the style of the top is very cute and maybe if i wanted it for skinny jeans, it would be ok. i returned them both to the store.

204,66,Great find,"Love this sweater. ordered white, size large. great light layer! the weave in the yarn is really pretty; the variations in texture have an almost burnout look. the silver buttons are unusual, really stand out and complement the overall look of the sweater. it has an uneven hem that drapes beautifully at the back and sides. great value on sale! one of those basics that everyone needs in their wardrobe.",1

205,34,Interesting pant!,I recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shown--and is actually a nice touch to make these different!  the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips.  i wear a 10-12 and the l is fine but i wouldn't want them any smaller.  super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute!,0
205,35,Gorgeous,This was an impulse purchase for me. a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me. i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring. this one did the trick! i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing. the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support. i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day. the jumpsuit is l,11

they run large. i usually wear a 28 but bought the 27 in these. ( 5'5"", 124 lb.) they also definitely stretch out while being worn, so you may be able to size down even furthe",11
205,55,,Pants fit great. true to size. did not stretch like some of the retailer pants that you need to buy in a smaller size. love that the calf is bigger than most of their pants which are usually too narrow for my bigger calves. very comfy look great with a white shirt and tie die is subtle. they will be a staple summer pair of pants.,0
205,58,The jumpsuit to end all jumpsuits,"This. jumpsuit. is. amazing.

i ordered the small, and it fits perfectly - loose and flowy, with room for boobs (i'm a 32d) and hips. perfect for humid summers when you'd rather your clothing hang a bit away from your body. the fabric is deceptively light for how it hangs (in a very flattering way) when i have it on.

207,38,Lean and long,Love the high rise and stretch of this jean- i feel long and lean which is tough for a short curvy girl! i feel these run a little small for pilcro- i went up a size.,2
207,38,Pilcro rules!,"I love pilcro and this pair is another proof why i love it! i bought a pair in light red - the color is so pretty. the fit is perfect. i normally wear petites, but this time bought a regular length, and i love it. it is not too long, as the pants are cropped, and not too short as the petite cut might have been.
pilcro never disappoints me, as i have many different pairs and love each one of them. may go for another color in this same style. they are awesome!!",2

fit true to size for me, almost had a hard mite buttoning... but they are stretchy, so don't buy a bigger size, they will stretch. could not decide which color to keep so kept both... i ordered the 25p (0p) - i am 5'1.5"", and 115 lbs... i think these are vanity sized, but my usual vanit",0

207,40,Flattering cut,"Really like these -- they fit really well and look great with a pair of chucks and a sweater if i'm dressing down a bit, as well as with flats and a nicer blouse. really versatile. i'm kind of pear-shaped, and these seem to minimize my flaws a bit, too, so that never hurts!",3

207,41,"Love everything about these, except for the butt.","As other reviewers have pointed out, the bum is not flattering. the pockets are wide and the fit sort of flattens you out. bummer. literally. too bad, i wanted these to work more than then coh's parker cropped. the coh's win. my wallet loses.",1
207,41,Runs small.,"I usually wear 26 or 27 in pants, but i sized up to a 28p for these. the waist is a little big but better fit overall. i ended up buying them in the white also.",0

the denim felt fabulous they just fit me a bit funky.",1

207,42,Love the way these pants make me feel!,"The fabric of the pants is a great thickness so the pants have a very nice look. the fabric is smooth, not jean material. for me this is nice because though they have weight to them, the pants are not hot and can be used to dress up or down, much more versatile than jeans. these pants are very fitted through the hips but then fall very nicely. i am not a big fan of capri length yet i really love these! i have already enjoyed wearing these out and they look fabulous with any type of wedge or heel",8

207,42,Will be my new sweats,"Bought on a whim, on sale.  i am a small in 95% retailer but got these in m for comfy casual looseness--perfect.  i am 5'8"", and these hit the top of my feet--perfect.  fabric is substantial but not heavy--perfect for cool so. cal evenings.   color is rich denimy blue--beautiful.  buttons are pretty. i have nothing negative to say about these aside from their price (even on sale).  oh, and the knot.  as i sit on my squishy leather sofa, i feel the knot in my back.  hmmm.  oh well.  still love them",4
207,42,,They are really cute. the fabric is a little stiff but the details are nice. the waist seems big so i suggest sizing down. i bought 27 p my usual size and sent them back for a 26 p because the waist was big.,1
207,43,A great look but not as shown online.,"These are super comfortable and with heels can be very flattering. i like the fact that you can wear them with or without the belt. 
however i wish that the color was the same darkness as shown online. they are lighter and a bit duller. i look at a few pairs and they are all the same. still love them but i'm sure they would have been even more fantastic if they looked like the picture.",1

207,44,,"Me: 5'6"", 130, waist 28/39, hips 36/37. tried the size 27, the usual for me in pilcro. they fit like a glove and i loved them. i clearly needed a 2-3"" heel to do them justice and now i see the photos of my rear i'm a bit doubtful but pilcros always stretch a little and these are super soft and funky.
a win!",4

207,45,Cute pants,"These ""jeans"" definitely look more like pants and are very snug, but stretchy. i'm 5'10 and ordered the tall, and mine are a little longer than shown on the model. they look nice on, but are a tad tighter than i anticipated.",5

207,46,Take the crop jean plunge,"I have a love affair with pilcro and these jeans make my heart throb. i've been stalking these jeans online and tried them on in the store yesterday. i'm 5'9"", curvy, and was concerned that they would make my legs look like tree trunks swathed in denim with miniature cartoon feet protruding from below the hem. not so. they fit like a glove, rested perfectly at my lower calf, hugged around the hips and waist, and flared without looking like church bells. seriously, if you're a cropped pants fan,",28
207,46,"Wonderful fabric, fabulously stylish","Softest denim -- they feel like they've been through the wash a hundred times already! i'm pleased that the belt is removable as it adds just a bit too much bulk for me. i'm 5'4"" and bought the petite for a perfect fit. these will become a go-to pair!",2
207,47,Jeans too heavy and large,"It was way to heavy and big for someone with a petite frame like me.

207,48,More faded than they look here,"I stopped into a store near me specifically to try these on given how adorable they look here. while i liked them, i didn't love them. i love some stretch, so that part was good. however, the denim was much thinner and lighter colored than they look to me online here. 


i really want to love them, though their light color has me less enthusiastic. another reviewer also mentioned a butt-flattening effect, which i noticed also. i might have sprung for them anyway, they do have a cute shape, bu",0
207,49,Individuality,"Great buy. i bought the cream jumpsuit.  i'm small on bottom and larger on top. this was perfect, shouldn't fit tight, should flow, has lots of room, it is linen, adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit. legs are wide and flowy. casual but classy. both sides have about 3 buttons at hips. great addition to any closet. unique in its own right.",7

207,51,Great jeans,"Love me some pilcro jeans! these fit like the stet jeans.

i got my usual size 27p and the fit is good but not too tight. i am not crazy about the hem but they feel so good that they are worth it. they don't come above my ankle like on the model but come slightly below which i really like. i will say that if you want a true black, you may not like this color. they are more of a faded black.",1
207,51,Nice fit for jeans,"I'm 5'4 and 125 and the 28 fit comfortably. i initially bought the 27 but felt it was snug in the seat so switched out for the 28, i'm 52 so didn't want the painted on look. they will need to be washed more frequently since they do stretch out as they are worn. love the gray color and goes with so many fall colors.",1
207,51,,"Best jeans ever! it's so hard to find a good petite jean. you shop and shiop and then pay $30 more to get them altered. the fit and length on these are perfect. love, love, love!!!",0
207,52,Beautiful color,"I just received the pink in the mail. i am 5' 5"" and around 140. i ordered the size 29, they fit perfectly. they are a very straight leg with a snug fit. you can adjust the cuff to whatever length you need or unroll them completely. the fabric is of beautiful quality. i basically never wear corduroy because it can add pounds. not so with this pair of pants. i am thinking about another color!!",0
207,52,Prob good if you're curvy,"Ordered these in 31p last year, prob could have worn a 30p, ordered 30p and 31p this year. the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy. this year neither size fit. 
this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit. it's the waist that doesn't work for me. if you're curvier this is probably a good fit change.",4
207,52,Super cute!,"First off, let me say that i am 52 and don't often go for print jeans these days:) however, these are just so stinking fun and flattering that i couldn't say no. these look great cuffed for warmer temps, and rolled to full length will be fun to wear with fall sweaters. if you are looking for something fun and flattering, these are the ticket! i bought the grey version and feel that they will work with many pieces that i already have.",2
207,53,Cute but not for me,Fit is just like stet in my opinion.,0
207,53,Great!,"The color, heft, style & quality are perfect. i did go down one size since my usual size was too large in the waist.",0
207,53,High waist,"Those are very cute and lavender color is very beautiful in person, however i do not like the cut. waist goes about inch higher than usual pilcro, which for summer heat is something i do not find neither practical nor pretty and unfortunately i have to send them back : (. also, this year pilcro runs little bit tighter in waist than usual, so you might consider ordering one size up if you are between sizes.",8

207,53,Nice but no...,"I should have looked more carefully at the description of these before i made the purchase. these jeans, unfortunately are very stretchy which i don't like at all. i was looking for 100% cotton with no lycra-love rigid denim so these are not for me. they have a very nice design and fit tts. they are very long so expect hemming if you are not 5'10 at least! the 29 was perfectly sized and will be flattering on a curvy figure, i would imagine. rear pockets are placed very low on the bottom giving t",2
207,54,Ideal proportions,"The most disappointing thing about buying flare jeans when you're 5'4"" is taking them to the tailor to have a chunk of what makes them flares hacked off. not so with the petite 31"" inseam on these!!! love the perfect amount of stretch, the rise is high but not too high and the flare is perfect. definitely recommend.",4
207,56,Not for me,"These jeans didn't fit like i thought , based on the model. i usually wear 25 , but these were snug and i i have snug jeans , lots of them and i wanted looser , flared jeans ,kind of a 60's look. not these. a bigger size wouldn't have improved it . they are a perfectly good jean , love the color but not what i wanted .",0
207,56,Too skinny for me,"I was so sad to have to return these pilcro jeans. my calves are just too athletic for these jeans. they weren't comfortable. they were a little loose in the waist. so, sizing up, would not have fit the tight in the calves problem. i have two pairs of stetson crop flares and they fit perfectly. in fact i love the pilcro stetson crop flare style. wish retailer would sell more of this style.",3
207,56,Warm grey,These are a lovely neutral to slightly warm grey pair of jeans from a great line. i wore my usual size without issues.,0
207,57,Great fitting jeans,"I love these jeans. the wash is nice enough for work. they fit well around the waist and have just the right mid-rise height, to make them stylish- not mom jeans at all. i am a pilcro convert. very comfortable too.",0

207,59,Great basic skinny jean,"I got these jeans on sale and have been very happy with them. they seem to go with everything - just a really nice basic skinny jean to have. lightweight with a little bit of give. they fit tts for me, and hit about an inch and a half longer on my legs than the model in the picture (i'm 5'6""). i've had them for a couple of months now and keep expecting them to show some wear in the knees bc of how often i wear them. not yet! any marks on them have come off easily in the wash. overall, very happy",1

207,60,Best summer jeans!,"These are my favorite pair of capris/ankle jeans ever! i'm 5'4"", 120lbs and got the 28 petite in gray. the fit is fantastic and the length is perfect for summer days (couple inches above my ankles). the gray color is so versatile and i can dress it up or down. i plan on getting it in other colors as well since the fit is so good.",3
207,60,Dark black interesting jeans!,"Love these pants. it's hard to get really dark dark black jeans with a little stretch, and these are perfect. i also like the cut as a bit of a change from skin tight leggings. and the fabric is super cool, like a lightweight brocade denim. i get compliments every time i wear them.",0
207,60,"Great fit, wish they were ankle length","These jeans fit great, but i think getting the right size is key. i bought my usual denim size 26 and at first i thought they were too tight. but as the day wore on, they softened and conformed to my body and fit like a glove. if i bought them in a larger size, i'm afraid they'd bag out like jeans tend to do. i think it's the ""legging"" style that makes them so form fitting. i wish they were ankle length like on the model, but i'm 5'5"" and they are quite a bit longer on me than the model.",0
207,60,Great jeans,"These are fabulous pants.  they can easily  be worn to work.  best jeans/pants ever for women with no butts!!  they stay up, and they're comfortable.

207,60,New favorite jeans,"Love these! loose and comfy everywhere. delighted to have found a 32, and delighted that they are roomy, even at the waist. i exchanged another pair of pilcro's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict, but as usual, retailer customer service was excellent. earlier sale price was honored, easy returns in the orignal shipping bag.. 
retailer design, fashion and company attitude excels!",1
207,61,Love these jeans!,"I absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans. i did have to size down. i ran into problems after washing. the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other, looking very unbalanced. after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying. the other leg did not have this stitching, thus the fraying double in size. i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair. these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc",7
207,61,Sooo flattering,"Saw these at my local retailer store and almost didn't try them on. so glad i did. they made my legs look long and lean. they run a little big and i decided to go down a size because i think they may stretch out after wearing for awhile. the material is fairly thick but i think that helped in making them appear to slim my hips, butt and thighs. the material is really pretty stretchy and that made them so comfortable. i love how i look in these!!!",5
207,63,I think pilcro are my favorite jeans.,"I love the serif jeans and these stet mid-rise jeans fit perfectly, too! true to size and i really like the wash. i am 5'4"" and a size 2, and the 26 fits just right. because of my height they come closer to the ankle on me than what you see on the model. i have more of an athletic build, rather than curvy.",3

207,64,Great fitting jeans,"I saw these on the freshly cut + promo discount & decided to order my usual size 28 reg in pilcro. a great fit & appreciate the midrise. not too snug or baggy. look pretty much on me as in the model pic except they fall abt 1"" below my ankles. i am only 5'3"" so not a surprise they are a little longer on me but it's really ok. fyi - the front button & back pocket tacks are gold which gives a classy look to these jeans. just love.. & love the price too! 5'3"", 117#",4

208,52,Sooo comfortable and slouchy/drapey - in good ways,"This is what i'd been looking for without even knowing it! it's long without being too long, and most importantly - its soft, not scratchy the way so many winter clothes can be. i wasn't sure if i should order the small or the medium so i went with the medium, and it fits great. the weave is just slightly wide, but not to the point where you have to wear a cami or tee underneath, but the fit is loose enough that you can, if you want to for added warmth. i really like it.",0

209,28,Beautiful pattern,"I lucked out and found one of these in my local retailer and i absolutely love it. fits well, although, i do think that the sleeves run a tad bit narrow when they are folded up, but i prefer the dress with the sleeves down anyway. fits very true to size. i can't wait to wear this with boots and leggings!",0
209,29,Meh,"The details on this dress were pretty, but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am. maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that, but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. fits tts.",1
209,29,Perfect bride dress,Fits perfect.,0
209,29,Stunning,"I did not notice this dress on the website. it was not until i saw it in store (was an online purchase & returned) - i was immediately in love. i love the color, texture and rosettes. i feel like a million bucks wearing it and have received so many compliments on it. before buying it, i actually ran home to gather a previous purchase and return it so i could buy this dress and not feel guilty! i am usually a 2 or 4 and the 6 fits perfect through and through. so happy with this lovely dress!",5
209,30,Fancy or casual,"Love this dress. i'm wearing it as a bridesmaid in a fall, casual outdoor wedding. i think it's fancy enough and can also be dressed down later. 

i'm 6' tall and skinny, with large breasts and this dress fits. beautiful! not too much cleavage. :)

it's not real lace but no one could tell. great quality and nice weight to dress. great for dancing and spinning!",0
209,30,More gorgeous in person,"This dress is even prettier in person. i'm 5'5"" and usually a 4 in fit and flare dresses and got this in a 4. fits like a glove and hits right above my knee. the hook and eye closure does get caught on the delicate lace, so be careful of that. otherwise, this dress is perfect for summer weddings!",1
209,31,Beautiful dress,"Love this dress! very feminine and flattering. i would say that it runs true to size, or a little big. size down for a snug fit at the waist.",1
209,31,Loved it,"I did not experience the issues the other reviewers mentioned. wore this to a wedding last month and received many compliments. beautiful, comfortable dress. the bust fit well -- slightly large on me (i am *just* a b) in the size i needed, but not horribly so. love this dress!",3
209,31,Runs big!!,"I am pretty standard size 8, 36c, 5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot;, 150 lbs. i ordered the small and the bust fit well but the whole thing was like a tent and way too flowy for my taste. it was also long so everything was very covered. i didn&amp;#39;t feel it flattered my build. i returned!",0
209,32,Cute and flattering,"Dress is very flattering on, not tent-like at all!",10
209,32,The best dress i own,"I splurged on this dress when it was first in stock a year ago and haven't regretted it for a minute. it is my go to dress for work, cocktails, and once, two weddings in one day! the print is gorgeous and the fabric is super comfortable. i love twirling in it as the dress has just enough stretch with a little flounce. the length is ladylike and the sleeves provide perfect coverage for my arms. the seam between the bodice and the skirt hits right at your natural waist and the look really flatters",5
209,33,Beautiful on,"I waited so long for a small petite to come back in stock and finally it did...received the dress last week and it's beautiful it was a perfect fit for me not to big not too small (my size 5'3""/122lb). if you're petite or very thin probably size down. i gave it 4 stars because of the quality...some of the eyelets looked a little weathered. it is lined and there's no see through. agree with other reviewers though - this dress is not worth $228 price tag.",0
209,34,Classic,"This dress is beautifully constructed. it is very fitted and does run on the small side. it will be a perfect derby dress. the lace is lovely and the pearl buttons are great touch. age appropriate for anyone..a very 
pretty dress. simple, classic and gorgeous!",0
209,34,Gorgeous lace!,"I was so pleased to receive this dress after purchasing it online -- the color is vibrant, the lace is beautiful, and it is fully lined! fit is true to size, and its a fit and flare dress so flattering for most body types. i could dress it up or down for lunches or weddings so overall, i think its a great dress for a great price!",3
209,34,Nice dress to hide flaws,,5
209,34,Perfect fit for gals with hips and hourglass shape,"I noticed half of the reviews on here were from women with a slim/straight and/or petite figure. fit-and-flare dresses simply will not work for you; it's the entire purpose behind the ""flare"" shape at the hip. it will be too large for women without wider hips.
-------------------------
that said, i found this perfect for me in every way. after having a baby, it's hard to find a dress that fits my more curvy shape where most of my weight fell on the hips and bust. i wish this dress was a tad long",5
209,34,Shimmering green classic cocktail dress,I love this dress because it is everything i have been looking for. it is flattering because of the details and it gives the illusion of an hourglass figure if you don't have one. i love that it has sleeves because sometimes i just don't feel like finding a shawl or bolero or whatever in case i get suddenly anxious about my arms. the green is dark and shimmering almost like lace over jewel tone emerald. love.,23
209,35,Great dress,"Wore this dress recently on a work trip. traveled very well, cut and fabric are super flattering",0
209,35,Not my favorite dress,"I saw this one for the first time today in-store and was not impressed. it is a lacey material with an under-layer, so with a different cut other than a swing dress i would have fallen in love and it would have been absolutely gorgeous. unfortunately, i did not like the swing dress cut, especially not in white. i wasn't sure if the designer was going for a throw back to the 70s or a shortened version of my grandmother's wedding gown, but either way it was not working for me. to be fair, swing dr",16
209,35,Wanted to love,"I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi, feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.",5
209,36,Not the same dress,"After reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model. the dress they sent me is not this dress. it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter, like a cross. there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer. it was scoop and if you pulled it down, the neck went up. the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here, is rava. the length measured at 39"" not the st",10
209,36,Not what i expexted,"While i had high hopes for this dress to be my ""go to"", unfortunately o couldn't get passed how cheap the material felt. the cut and pattern both worked on my petite frame, however, the cut out pieces in front are not lines and exposed the top portion of my bra.",0
209,37,Just ok,Looks better online than in person. material makes it look a little puffy,0
209,38,,I'm 5'1 and 110 lbs.  i ordered this in a xsp and i could barely zip it up.  and when i did i couldn't breathe. i tried again and ordered a sp and it's perfect! now i just need somewhere to wear it.,0
209,39,,"Beautiful fabric, but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed, but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look. 

also, the arms and the top portion are a tad small, so if you have a larger bust/arms, this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall, but was no way for me to make it work.",2
209,40,Not so sure about it,"I was really excited for this dress to come and hoped it would work well for a couple of holiday parties that i will be going to this season. i wasn't sure what i thought when trying it on, but i am thinking it will go back since i still am not super excited about it. for me the waistline was a bit high, and it had a bit of a frumpy feel. i love the floral pattern but overall it just wasn't amazing.",0
209,40,,This is my new favorite dress!,0
209,41,Do not buy this dress,"I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first, it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups, they are really only designed to fit cones, not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad, because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.",17
209,42,Very versatile,,2
209,42,,"Beautiful dress; however, the top was small for my chest and the rest ran large.",3
209,46,Comfortable and colorful dress,"I bought this dress for an early fall wedding, i usually wear a size 14 and bought a large. it was loose and swingy, very comfortable, almost too big. i would size down if you are in between. this dress was so easy to wear, i would definitely bring it on vacation. you can pair any type of shoes- flats, sandals, heels, wedges would all look good.",1
209,46,Pretty doily,,0
209,47,Pretty dress,"I really love this dress but am deciding whether to keep it because, while it fits well in the skirt and around my torso, it is tight in the arms. i can't really lift my arms above should height. the plus is that it would keep me from bidding too much at my kid's school auction. the negative is that it would be hard to dance in.",9
209,48,Just average,"First of all, the label on this dress is maeve, not nue by shani. second, i just wasn't impressed. the fabric is cool...it has a sort of embossed look to it and it's somewhat shiny, which sets it apart in a good way. but the cut is just boring. the top felt dowdy to me...overall, i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it.",8
209,50,,"This dress looked so cute on the model, but unfortunately not so much on me. it appeared so much more fitted in the picture than it actually is. i ordered the xs and it is huge on me. definitely a tunic/swing style, rather than streamlined. my husband said it looked frumpy on me. it is also longer than it appears on the modei. for reference i am 5' 4""
i wish this would have worked, but i need something more fitted for my body type. if you are looking for an unfitted tunic style, this could be s",3

209,53,Three strikes,"I am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason. the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it. i can't imagine how they got it to fit this model so well. i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves, so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue. unfortunately, i had the same problem. i am a c+ cup size. perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust. i ordered t",13
209,56,Gorgeous - but.......,"I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however, the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4"", 138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment, too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this.",4
209,56,Horrifying fabric,"I had a dress that felt like this in 1993. it jiggles, even if you don't. no amount of spanx can cure a dress jiggling of its own accord. the neckline that i had thought would be classic instead veered into frumpy. all in all i felt like it belonged in a discount store surrounded by polyester brethren.",7
209,58,Buy it now!!,"I got this dress on sale (under 20 dollars) but i would pay more!  it runs very large - i got a medium which is roomy, irl i wear a large (vanity sizing i suppose!).  the colors are so pretty, it is lined so you don't need a slip or cami.  highly recommend!",0
209,60,Absolutely gorgeous!!!,"This dress is one of the most beautiful dresses i have seen. purchased for my daughter . . . it was as if you made this dress for her. had to return it because the woven fabric was fraying around the back v neckline and zipper. was able to replace it, the replacement looks good -- have a concern about two areas but we will see. just love the lines and fit of this dress! truly hope the fabric holds up.",6
209,62,Beautiful dress!,I actually bought this dress last year and they made another one in a similar dark floral which i also bought--because i love this dress so much! i wish they would make a different pattern--i'd buy a third one! the online picture does not do any justice to this dress. fits like a dream---soooo flattering. modest but not matronly at all. flows beautifully. i have received tons of compliments every single time i wear this dress. this dress is absolutely lovely. please make this in another pattern!,1
209,83,Elegant!,"It was love at first sight when i saw this dress online. the color, cut and delicate details are perfectly balanced with a moderately sexy neckline! ladylike with a little attitude. the fabric is gorgeous and is a stunning shade of midnight blue. this dress is perfect for a summer beach party or to attend a wedding. cut is extremely flattering, and the halter tie top allows for adjustment for a perfect fit.

210,29,Gorgeous!,"I'd been looking for a replacement for my faux leather jacket and this has surpassed my expectations. well-made, lovely color, very soft, flattering cut. it runs small so i sized up from my usual petite xs to a petite s. it's warm and the lining is very pretty. hopefully it'll hold up to daily wear. i'd definitely recommend it as a great jacket to take you from fall - spring. i got the plum color.",0
210,31,Awesome jacket!,"A friend of mine has several of these jackets and i always asked ""where did you find that from?"" the answer? retailer vegan leather jackets! i bought 2 when they were on sale and i love both (grey and dark brown/purple). they are super comfy and surprisingly warm. can dress up or dress down for any occasion. i can't wait to buy more!",0
210,33,,"I'm very pleased with this jacket! i've never owned a ""vegan"" leather anything, so i didn't know if it would show up cheap looking or smelly.. but to my surprise, it didn't have a ""smell"" or that shiny cheap look. i'm so glad i headed the other reviewers advise and i sized up, my typical size would have been to tight and short! i'm excited to wear this with dresses and jeans this fall! i bought the ""honey"" color and it's more like a cross between beige and blush(a slight dusty pink hue)! i love",1
210,33,,Love this jacket! it is incredibly soft and expensive looking. i love the details with the zippers on the sleeves and very cute lining inside the jacket which is not pictured. i ordered my usual size xxsp and it fit great. this brand does run small so if you are between sizes or prefer a looser fit you should order a size up.,7

210,36,"Nice cut, runs a little small","I love this jacket. i have not worn it yet, as the weather is still very warm, but i am looking forward to wearing this a lot this fall. the cropped cut is very flattering and the vegan leather very soft, i followed the other reviews and ordered one size up and it;s perfect. i am normally a size 4 and went with he medium. the plum color is quite neutral in person. i also love the printed lining. i did notice quite a few long threads around the lining sewing, i hope this is just an overlooked pos",0
210,37,,"So happy with this jacket! i have looked for what feels like forever for a vegan leather jacket that is (1) long enough in the sleeves and (2) wide enough in the shoulders without being bulky through the body. i found it ran true to size. my usual large for well, xl was a little big. the material is beautiful and soft and the colors are great. i ordered the honey and cognac and love them both.",0
210,41,Beautiful,"This jacket is stunning. the vegan leather has a slight shimmer. the waterfall fabric is nice and soft. it's really beautiful and unique. cropped jackets tend to shorten me, but the cascading waterfall fabric add a nice little bit of length that just balances the jacket nicely. the sleeves in the xxsp petite size that i tried on were tight. they were better in the xsp but i won't be wearing any thick sweaters underneath. it fit everywhere else. i'm usually an xxsp, and sized up for the arms. ove",2
210,41,Gorgeous jacket,"I was lucky enough to see this in store when it went on sale and although i rarely wear leather/vegan jackets i tried it on. i am torn on sizing i'm normally a m or 8/10 in retailer but the m fit slightly tight in the waist and the l was slightly loose. i ended up with the l in the moss color, since i can layer and don't really want the jacket too cropped. i also saw the brown and tried that on but for me the moss color was much richer.",3
210,41,"Nice, unfortunately didn't work for me","I was so excited to receive this jacket - have been looking for a ""leather"" jacket for a while and thought this would be the perfect one. unfortunately, i have broad shoulders and it seemed a little tight. i got my normal size s based on retailer shirts. maybe if i got the m? although, the s fit well in the waist, so... also, my small chest (32b) didn't fill out the darting in the chest area. one last wish, was that it was a little longer.

210,47,Adorable jacket!,"I need to remember that this brand runs small. i ordered the xxsp and i usually have a little room with jacket, but this fits snug. i have one from last year and it's the same. fits snug. if you want extra room, order a size up. the quality is nice, i love the camel brown color. it's a keeper for me, just won't be able to wear a sweater under it.",13
210,52,Beautiful jacket - feels like leather,"This jacket feels like quality and has beautiful detailing. one thing to note though, the proportions are a little odd - it is cut very high in the back (at the waist) and the sleeves seem over-long.",0
210,70,Awesome jacket,"I wasn't sure the shorter length in the back was working until i tried it on. this jacket totally worked for me. the brown color can be easily matched with other colors. i got the jacket in medium size. i usually in between size. the medium size allow more space on the chest area, however the sleeve becomes a bit too long for me.",0

211,27,Drapes so beautifully,I wasn't sure about this top but i had a feeling i needed to at least try it on. it drapes so beautifully and the keyhole neck is a lovely little touch. i love the asymmetric hemline and the fabric is incredibly soft. as far as the fit goes i found that it did run slightly small.,0
211,28,"Nice top, but not for petites with larger busts","Overall, a really nice top that is soft and comfortable. the arm length hits nicely on the forearm and the decorative detail at top is well-constructed. didn't keep this since the top made me look quite big in my bust, to the point of not being flattering. top is also a bit boxy, so i'd stay away if you are petite, with a larger bust unless you are okay with that emphasis.",0
211,30,"Flowy, lightweight, and easy","I typically wear a medium, but went with a large because i am pregnant and tall. i think i could have used the medium in width, but like the length of the large. it is a wider fit and is significantly shorter in the front than the back, but i think works with the look of the top. i think you could dress it up or down and the fabric is cozy. i would highlight that it has a wider fit, but i think that is the design of the top. overall, i am pleased and i think meets my search for an off the should",0

211,34,Beautiful top,"I was in love with this top from the moment i put it on. it is of high quality, with layers to ensure the top isn't sheer. the embroidery is so pretty and the top looks way less grandma in person. i ordered the petite xxs and it fits perfectly. i really appreciate that the underarm holes are just the right size and don't show off any of my bra, which sometimes happens with sleeveless tops. i can wear it with jeans and boots or with a pencil skirt and heels and it looks great with both outfits. o",1

211,37,Fun little tank!,"Love this. the stripes are cute and simple, but even better is the texture of the fabric (do a close up on the photo if you can). it's a swing tank, so there is a lot of fabric, but styled the right way and this is dreamy :) i passed on it only because i like my tops much longer than usual and this one wasn't quite long enough for me. i tried true to size and had it been longer i would have went with it - but smaller ladies might want to down size a size or two :)",5
211,37,Great style!,"Just picked this up at my retailer and i just love it. its totally different than your typical tee. the bottom is more of a blousy silk material and the top is a super soft knit. it lays really well and is long enough to wear with leggings! my favorite part is the t strap in the back. such a beautiful detail and so much fun. my only criticism with this top is where it hits on the bust. im a little more full figured, so the top looks better on me when the silk part isn't under my boobs. kinda have",2

212,35,Simple & casual dress,I'm petite and pear shaped so i'm small on top and curvy around the hips and love the way this dress fits. it's a relaxed fit so it's not super fitted and it's loose around the waist which is great. it's a wonderful casual dress to wear with a pair of tall boots. i adore it!,7

212,56,Very flattering dress,"This is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk. i received many compliments when i wore this, with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry. the fit is true to size, i took my usual size l. it is longer on me than the model, and my only complaint is the slip-it is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together, so i had to find a different slip. i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer, i don't",5
212,56,Way way too big,"I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however, when i tried it on, i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality, but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also, the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos, and the floral print isn't as r",9
212,57,Runs big,"I wanted to love this dress so much, but unfortunately it ran way too big for my taste. i am usually a 4/6 in retailer, and the small was huge on me. the bottom half of the dress is very much a ""swing"" dress and is very wide, much wider than it looks in the pictures. i suppose that sizing down (maybe even to a petite), and having the dress altered to be narrower on the bottom half would've made it look like the picture, but that's a lot of extra work for a dress that is already pretty pricey.",1
212,57,Way too short,"I'm 5'7"", 130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am, and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular.",0
212,59,,"Very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big. returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium, it was apparently not available in the medium, i was charged a 5.95 fee for return shopping. so i immediately went to website, medium available and i had to pay another 12.95 for shipping. seems a bit unreasonable, but really liked the dress.",10
212,62,Yes yes yes,"I've been looking for the right red dress for a while and this one is a winner! flattering fit, comfy quality fabric...makes me feel great even right after having a baby. fits tts and i can't wait to rock this beauty!",4
212,63,Cute dress,"I just received this today by mail, i am going to keep it as the reddish color is really pretty, it is very lightweight and will travel well for my summer vacations. however my first observation is the same as was noted in a previous review - not quite sure how to keep this dress in place - as soon as you move your arms around the dress goes out of place - and it slips back onto your shoulders . hopefully it will work out, will try a couple more times before i make a final decision i think.",0
212,63,Not for me,"I'm usually a petite, but bought in regular xs. perhaps a petite would have worked better, but this was way too low cut in front and back. i did not like the way it hung on me at all. i'm 5;2"" and 105 lbs, but regular xs normally fits better than this did. i could barely keep the shoulders from slipping off. sorry, it's a return for me.",0
212,63,"Stunning, flattering, and versatile.","This dress first caught my eye online. due to the price i resisted. then i saw in store and tried on...i decided to hold off for a sale, but my will was getting thin. once i saw it start to sell out online, i had to take the plunge. i knew this dress was a must have. it is super flattering and comfy! the best of both worlds. i'm small-chested so both the s and m fit, but the seam on the s fit a bit higher, which was more flattering on me, so s is what i got. it can be dressed up or slightly down",0
212,63,,"Nice material, hits high waisted, mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good, you couldn't tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer.",5
212,63,,"The fabric , feel and design of this dress is sooo cute, but so large that sadly, it will need to go back. beautiful and softly flowing design but so full that not flattering.",0
212,66,"Synthetic fabric evokes ""cheap"" quality",I love the style the lightness and the fit ... but the fabric in the skirt just did not meet my expectations. this might be something to find at a mass retailer. i guess i simply prefer a natural fabric.,1
212,67,Little black winter dress,"I found this dress to be perfect for the winter season. its warm, sleek, and classy. this dress is made in the usa so it is worth the price. i love the opening on the back and find it be flattering. it can be worn with tights for the winter and easily worn without in the summer. a wise investment for my closet!",0
213,35,Unexpectedly wonderful,"So, i really like the plaid designs by siyu. i saw these pants and questioned whether they would be tight and scratchy and ill fitting, but they were so cute, i had to find out. i'm really glad i did. the wool is soft and actually a little stretchy. it has an elastic waist, which is a plus, because sometimes, even if the legs fit, the waist is too small, or vice versa. i am a large, and very curvy on the bottom, and these are perfect and flattering, and the elastic waist is just right. as on the",3
213,37,Way too big/colors off,"Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4"", 110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green, the red is much more red than rust colored, etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm, but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store.",6
213,54,Nice coat but....,I liked this coat but my family said it looked too much like something hilary clinton would wear. i am 54 and i think it made me look a bit dowdy since it runs a bit big.,2
214,23,Not black,"For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words, i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist, it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir",2
214,27,Big and beautiful,Love everything about this skirt but the sizing. i'm a size 6/medium in almost everything but this skirt swallowed me. i wise there was a small or even extra small to try out. i'm also 5'5 and the skirt was right at my knees. definitely size down if you want it to look like the pictures.,1
214,29,"Pretty fabric, ok fit","This skirt is a really beautiful print and made of a lovely silky fabric. i didn't have the ""see-through"" issue that the other reviewer mentioned, my main concerns were the length (i'm 5'1 and it almost goes to my ankles) and that it poofs out a little right below the waist band. i'm between a small and a medium and went with the small. it fits but i wonder if it would lie flatter and be more flattering if i had gone with a medium instead.",0
214,31,Beautiful!,I saw this skirt online and immediately went to the store to hunt it down.  is perfect!  one of the most beautiful items of clothing i own.  was worried the waistband would be unflattering since i'm short and curvy but it's very flattering.  can dress up or wear to the beach.  i love it!!,3
214,31,"Loved, but returned","The colors weren't what i expected either. the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldn't find anything to really go with it. fabric is thick and good quality. has nice weight and movement to it. the skirt just wasn't for me, in the end.",0
214,36,A step above basic,"Great knee length, lovely twirl and drape. though a staple piece, the material and the blend of the navy and black bring this skirt up a notch. pull on styling. i purchased a small and returned it for an extra small as it was too large in the waist. i like my skirts to sit at the natural waist and with the style of this skirt, i think that would look most flattering and slimming. my waist is abt 26/27 for reference (34c bust and hips abt 35/36) and typically a 2/4 at retailer. the skirt is quite s",3
214,36,Nice skirt,,0
214,38,Beautiful and very flattering,"I love everything about this skirt! the fabric is super comfy and it drapes wonderfully. fits great. a bit long for me as i'm 5'6 but totally worth it. i don't wear heels so i might need to alter the length, but i knew it would be long when i ordered it. i purchased the grey, but i might have to order the taupe as well!",3
214,44,Comfy,,0
214,48,Seriously beautiful,"This skirt is stunning. like the other reviewer, i believe this is probably the most beautiful thing in my closet. the colors are just striking. it is also flattering - i find some skirts can kind of pouf out around the hips and add bulk, this one lays nice and flat and looks great. the material is very soft and simple and i love the frayed edges at the bottom. i am just between 5""3"" and 5'4"" and weigh 112 lbs; i took an xs and it fits perfectly, so it seems true to size. only thing, if you are",3
214,52,Cute skirt for next summer,Fits well. true to size. love the kelly green color and found a blouse to match. the see-through part gives it some oomph and a little extra sexiness without being inappropriate for work. only downside is the beige color--kind of a funky bandaid-colored beige. but the blue and the green balance it out.,0
214,54,Nice skirt,Nice skirt. texture pattern gives it character. does run a bit large.,0
214,54,Perfect summer skirt,"I love this skirt! fits like a dream, fabric is soft, light, and drapes perfectly. i bought the skewed pullover to wear with it and the colors are perfect. my new favorite summer outfit.",1
214,61,Feminine skirt,,6
215,28,,"I loved how this looked on the model, however, once i tried on in store, i was greatly disappointed. i usually wear a meduim and the small and extra-small were huge on me. there was so much extra material that i was swimming in this. i had such high hopes for this. there were no petite sizes to try on in the store but i am not sure it would have helped.",3
215,37,First fall favorite,This poncho is dreamy. the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person. there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much. the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine. its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall. my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy. it being wool i can't say that i'm surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat,5
215,51,More like a bathrobe,"Big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat. there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy - just a bit of string. the color is great, but the quality leaves something to be desired.",11
215,52,Cozy cape,I saw this initially in the store and thought it was nice but did not purchase because i thought the price was too high.  i saw it again and it was on sale but the store had sold out of my size.  i checked online and my size was available so i ordered.  i was afraid this cape would be to long and make me look frumpy but it wasn't and i didn't.  it looked great. i tie the belt a little higher than the model to make me look taller.   i can't wait to wear it on cool fall days.,0
215,56,Beautiful coat,I love this coat. i would definitely recommend it. i normally wear a size 6 or a medium. i bought my normal size and had to return it for a small. customer service was great and made for an easy online exchange.,0
215,56,,I ordered the chelan wrap coat in the beautiful red color. it's artsy and will be fun to wear with jeans and other casual clothing. it's super comfy and fits true to size.,0
215,61,Beautiful but short,"Liked everything about this coat but the length! it is beautiful and good quality. first, ordered a medium because the fit seemed slight (i'm a 4-6), returned it for a large. unfortunately, the large will also be returned -- the body length is very cropped, not at all as it appears in photo to meet the top of a waistband. i'll hope to find a similar coat with just a bit more length.",2
215,62,Madly in love!,,2
216,21,Classy top,"I ordered this top in white and i was really excited for it to come in! once it once delivered and i tried it on it took me a second to decide if i liked it or not. i think i ordered it a size too big (i ordered a large, i'm usually a medium). it was somewhat boxy, but i think paired with the right pants and shoes it would be just what i wanted!",0
216,24,"Very cute, snug fit","Very cute flowy fit. i am generally a size small, 32-d chest. because the material has no give it fits perfectly (just barely) if it was any smaller or i was any larger it would be too small. very cute design.",0
216,25,"Love this shirt, but buttons are unstable","This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.
the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it, another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.",0

216,26,Gorgeous detail,,0
216,26,Great top,I tried this in store and fell in love. i'm usually between a 0 and a 2 in tops and took this in a 0 because of how flow and lose this is. the fabric is light and not bulky so it can also be tucked in.,0
216,26,Such a lovely top!,"I came across this in the store and immediately fell in love with it. the online photos just don't do it justice! i bought the white version because the little pops of red in the details and the dobby weave are so sweet and unique. 

a size 0 fit perfectly. the fabric is a bit sheer, so be prepared to wear a cami underneath. very light, airy, and comfortable!",2
216,26,,"This top fits perfect everywhere except the sleeves are a little tight. not uncomfortably so but i wish they had just a little more room so they looked like they did in the picture. other than that, i love this shirt! its super cute and comfy and i have gotten a few compliments on it!",0
216,28,Functionality with flair,This top is the perfect combo of function and flair! the style of the top makes it easy to wear and the back detail is just lovely. i love that it can be worn as either a buttoned-up top or a light over-shirt with a t-shirt or camisole underneath. i would pair this with blue or gray skinny jeans.,0
216,29,Sweet top,"This top is cute - nice fabric and design. pretty flattering for such a loose cut. my one concern though, was that when i was moving the peplum part kept riding up. i felt like i would constantly have to readjust the shirt to make sure it was lying flat. 

the shirt runs large. i'm usually a 6, and the 2 was plenty roomy.",12
216,29,Versatile and gorgeous,"I was a bit hesitant to purchase because of the other reviews but so glad i did! i usually wear a 4-6 and the 6 fit great. it feels like high quality and i think the shirt will work well for both work and casual events. i have a long torso and don't find it too short at all. it is a tad tight across the shoulders, so if you are broad in that area, it might not work for you. overall, love!",2
216,30,Button problems,"Stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily. loved the look, so bought it anyway. lost 2 buttons on the first wear. it did not feel snug on me, but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better. either way i will return or exchange.",2

216,32,Beautiful but thin,"I am very petite (size 00, xxs) and i got the smallest size this top came in and it fit great in the bust and arms but the bottom billowed out a little too much for my body frame type. it is so beautiful i had considered getting it altered, but the material was simply too see through so it had to go back. beautiful gauze material and detailing though!",2
216,32,Beautiful softness,"This shirt has an incredible softness to it and the purple print is so lovely, i did end up returning it simply because the flowiness was a bit too much for me. i had tried the 2 and 4 and went with the 4 due to arm restrictions in the smaller size. too bad because it really is a lovely top. definitely worth a try in store!",14

216,34,A true beauty,,1
216,34,Beautiful but fit is off,This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit,2

216,34,Could be cute on the right person,I wanted to love this shirt. it's not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just wasn't flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn't right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.,3

pros:
- beautiful detailing at the bottom that isn't as evident from pics here. it really sets the top apart.
- double-layered but breathable fabric means no see-through issues and can be worn in the hot summer months ahead.
- lace detailing at the top is nice and elegant.
- roomy without being too boxy. nice flow.
- great fabric. forgiving fit.
- can be dressed up or down.

216,34,Odd cut,I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.,0
216,34,Very flattering but between seasons,This is beautiful on. it flatters the figure nicely. the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin. it is very low cut but it looks wonderful.,0
216,34,Worth every penny!,The material this top is made of is extremely comfortable and flattering for my body type.  i normally wear 12/14 and 12 fit great (if you have a d or bigger you may need a bigger size) spillage is possible with wrong size lol.,9
216,35,Beyond cute,"This top is one of my favorites, i can't get over how much i love the design. the dots are adorable and i received a ton of compliments. the back of the top quite a bit longer, and it looks great. my only complaint is that it runs a bit small on the top. even though the shirt is perfectly sized on me, i bent over to slip on my shoe and one of the buttons popped off after less than a minute of wearing it.",1
216,35,Fun and flirty,"This is a great casual top for spring! i loved the covered buttons in the back, and the longer back peplum too. the peplum in the front covers the top of pants. i am 5'9"" tall and often times have difficulty finding sleeves that are long enough, so the 3/4 length sleeves are perfect. the fabric is light weight but not sheer, and the embroidered dots are well done.",1

216,35,Great top!!,"I purchased this top in a great sale! fits great,true to size i am xsmall-small for reference, purchased small. i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable. it would be great in the fall with a cardigan/ sweater, or a blazer. super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans!!",0
216,35,Pretty but not for me,"I was initially drawn to the intricate floral design of the neutral motif. it looks huge and boxy, so i sized down to a 0- which ended up being too tight in the chest and arm holes (for reference, i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, 34a). i returned it for a size 2, which fit much better. in the end, i decided not to keep it because of the lack of shape, and it's a little unflattering for smaller busts. it does come with a matching cami and seems well-made, but it just wasn't for me.",0
216,35,"Smaller arms, larger body","I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer, but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest, but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10"", 140#, 34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted, and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect",7
216,35,So many compliments,"I have so many compliments on this blouse. i love the style and design. i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 5""8 tall. i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it won't look right in the back kinda hang out. otherwise really nice quality blouse. i would definitely buy another just to have a back up.",0
216,35,Super cute!,"I was a little hesitant to order this, thinking it would be too large and unflattering but thankfully i was wrong. this shirt is super cute and comfy. it is a bit of an oversized fit but the fabric drapes nicely and is quite flattering. my new go to outfit this fall will be this shirt with the sleeves rolled up, ankle jeans and my fave oxfords. i'm 5'3"", 115lbs and went with the size 4 regular",0

216,36,Run and buy.....,"Such a cute shirt! i picked up the white-with-flowers that is not being shown online yet. the straight white looks like it could wrinkle and definitely needs a tank underneath but the white with flowers was not see-through and seems like it will require a bit less steaming (the detail masks wrinkles :)) the flowered-design also has a small tie at the neck that i don't think was on the solid color design (can't totally remember) - cute extra detail but not overly obvious, it blends into the shirt",11

216,40,Perfect party top,This top has glam written all over it. the pleating gives it a delicate look but is not cheaply made or feeling. it lays so beautiful...i would say this runs tts but because i am busty i sized up to give it more of flowy look. because i am busty it also looks like high low blouse. no need for a necklace the flowers and shimmer do all the work for you. i paired it with leather leggins and it was adorable.,1

216,42,Not a white background,"Love this top. it's everything all the previous viewers said....except that the white isn't white but a creamy white.it has a yellow under tone.. this restricts my over all plans,but i still like it.",4
216,42,Perfect,"I love this blouse. i debated because of the cost. but this is a top i will wear forever. i have not found any of the issues other reviewers have. fit fine in the arms and the length was perfect and i have a long torso. i wear it with a nude bra and i don't have any problems with its being see through. i wore it to a party the other day and received several compliments. i was also stopped in the store and asked where i got it. it looks expensive and special. i worn it with jean, black jeans and",4
216,42,,"This shirt is really cute but a little stiff. it does come with a slip, but the slip was tight, but the shirt fit, maybe even a little big. i used another cami under which was better. i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt. i got it in the store with the 30% off, so it was a good deal. it does stretch out as you wear it, so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger, but still cute on and for a summer shirt, it's thin, so it does work well in that r",2

216,43,Exquisite top!,"Saw this in the store, looked at the price tag and decided to wait for a sale. got it this weekend with the 20% off and love it! (thanks retailer) wore it for my birthday dinner and received a ton of compliments. as someone else noted, it does catch on itself so take care when wearing. also, the slits on the side are semi-high but as my husband noted, this makes it a touch sexy instead of just a tunic. i went with an 8 for this reason(you could also wear a tank underneath). and yes, even on sale,",1
216,43,Heavy fabric. large top,"I love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears--very detailed. it is both subtle (not cheap looking) and special.

as an earlier reviewer noted, the top is not see-through, a plus.

the drawbacks, though, mean that i will be returning this top. 

1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well. i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose, even in that size, and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives",3
216,44,Cute and comfortable,I love this shirt. i bought the ivory color. it's incredibly comfortable and an easy style.,0
216,44,Fantastic blouse!,I love this top! the top has nice details and is not too sheer. it did have a smell at first but that's gone now.,0
216,44,Love this top,,2
216,44,Pretty and feminine,"I saw the neutral motif in the ""there's only one left"" hanger in the store and tried it on. it's very pretty, cute and sweet. i wish the bottom flares out a bit more like a baby-doll look, but that's just my preference. i tried on size 2 and it's a bit tight in the chest area (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), so i think size 4 would fit very well. despite the pretty flower design, in my personal opinion, i think the price does not justify a pretty basic tank top and fabric.",13
216,44,Wearing this to my reunion!,"I had been to the retailer store several times in hopes in finding the perfect top for my upcoming reunion. as soon as i saw this, i knew it was perfect for the occasion. i'm sure i'll get a lot of use out of this top as you can dress it up or down.",0
216,45,Love this blouse!,"This is one of the best purchases f
i have made at retailer recently. i got this in ivory in my usual xs. the pictures do not do it justice.  it has such a nice drape and i love the detail on the back.  looks great with black cropped trousers, as well as skinny jeans.",0
216,45,,"Easy breezy top that goes with so many outfits. i am petite (5'0'', 115lb), but like the longer look of a top, so went with 4r, thought that the arm holes would be too small if went with 2r. there is a lot of excess material around the sides...and back. i was tempted to return, but the armhole issue prevented me and it was so cute, i kept it. i think it will go through the a few seasons (seattle is unpredictable weather-wise...) and can be easily layered. i like the blouse...but don't love.",0

216,46,Bravo!,"I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic,that will be in my closet for a long time.",0
216,46,"Pretty, soft, comfortable and true to size","I ordered this in xl and the fit on me matches the fit on the model. it's meant to be loose & flowy so i think it's true to size. everything matches the photos--the sleeve length, hem, neckline, etc. it's not a slimming look but doesn't make me look bigger than i am either.

the material is a very soft cotton. the pattern of the lace on the top portion is very pretty. there are sequins mixed with the embroidery on the sleeves. the thread they used for those cutout areas is soft. it's washed well",0
216,46,Size 16 is perfect,I ordered the orange plaid version in size 16. it fit me like it does the model. it's true to size. the peplum is very comfortable. the plaid isn't see-through so no extra layer of a tank is needed. the neckline isn't too low. very well-made and a great choice for summer!,1
216,47,,,0
216,48,Casual elegance!,I am so glad i purchased this top and read the reviews thoroughly. i am usually a 10 or medium in tops because of my broad shoulders (for reference 5'9 145 lbs and athletic build). i decided to size down to an 8. the top fits perfect and looks just as pictured. it is a bit more substantial then i expected. the details and embroidery are beautiful and make this top so uniquely retailer! it is casual in an elegant way. i will be pairing this with skinny jeans and/or white skinny pants. i cannot tell,0
216,48,Wonderful shirt!,I love this shirt! the pictures do not do it justice. intricate detail. lovely.,11
216,49,In love!,"The details on this top are absolutely gorgeous, from the lace, to the sequins, to the rhinestones! that said, the details are not overpowering, yet more subtle. can't wait to wear this over the holiday season. sure to get tons of compliments!!",0
216,49,Love the details,"This top is really pretty. i love the details on the back tail of the shirt. the colors in this shirt are really pretty more like a peachy pink to me. i will however line dry this shirt because of the different fabric on the tail of the shirt. i would not iron that portion of the shirt either. overall, i am completely in love with this shirt. it will be a staple in my closet.",4
216,50,Another beautiful white top,Great fit,0
216,50,Even more beautiful than pictured,"This top is unique and gorgeous! i'm a singer and i knew i had to have it for an upcoming performance. it's got a really great ethnic/bohemian beauty and femininity to it. i saw the top on-line, then i went to the store to try it on. it is delicate- it has beading, embroidery and mesh, so one has to be careful putting on jackets, brushing up against things, etc. but it's well worth it. please note that due to the lining, it does run small, i had to go up a size. depending on how you'd like it to",7
216,51,Here comes summer,"Looking forward to wearing this blouse for the summer. easy to wear--no special bra needed. thin cotton material will be perfect for vacationing in japan. i wear a 4p but because the smocking in the shoulder area leaves the lower part of the shirt a bit blousy, i bought the 2p. i prefer the straight hems instead of the dresses and tunics with the longer back hem, which gives my petite frame the illusion of looking shorter. i liked this blouse so much that i bought it in the green and white strip",11
216,51,"Nice summer top, but very billowy","I got the green motif color which is really multi color: blue, orange, purple, yellow, green and brown. the fabric is gauzy and sheer, nice and breezy for summer. there is a subtle stitching detail at the shoulders. i ordered my usual size, medium, and it fits well in the shoulders and arm holes, but it is extremely billowy in the body. i had to take it in a couple inches on each side to make it a little less full. it's still has some swing, but not quite as much as before.",1
216,51,,,0
216,52,"Cute design, with adorable dots","This is much cuter in person than in the picture. in person, i am much more aware that it is also a lower length in the back and it flairs just a little so that the design really stands out. i bought in the white and blue dots and can see wearing it in the now, spring, and even summer! it is just a tad tight in my size 10, so i went up to a 12. thank you retailer - this will be timeless!!",8
216,52,Pretty tank,Love tanks and this one is sweet and flowy. great with jeans/shorts or slacks with a jacket for the office. beautiful yellow floral with fun straps in the back that you can wear with a bra. front neckline is cut narrow so bra straps show but with nude or plastic straps it's not that big a deal.,0
216,53,Mid winter addition,"I picked this tunic up on sale; it works wonderfully with several of my cardigans and vests; just add skinny jeans or leggings and some boots for a fun, super comfortable look. the sleeves are oddly extra long, but not a deal breaker as rolling them up gives that unfinished cool look. i hate ironing, but i will iron this top as its so much fun to wear. the embroidered and beaded detail is quite nice.",0
216,54,Flattering and so cute,I was afraid it would be too poufy but it isn't at all. i'd say it runs a bit large. i usually wear a 6 or 8 and the 6 fits perfectly.,2
216,54,Pretty blouse,"Most peasant tops have a lot of detail at the chest, such as gathering, yoke inlay, ties etc. i like this peasant blouse because it has a simple top part, so it does not add volume to the chest. good for busty figures. pretty top, though colors a bit more autumnal than pictured.",0
216,54,Really versatile!,,1
216,55,Absolutely gorgeous!,"When i walked into my retailer store i was immediately drawn to this top. the online photo really does not do it justice. in person, it is stunning. i'm petite and usually a size 4, but the only sizes available were a 0 and a 6. it looked large so i tried the 0. it actually fit much better than i expected, considering i have a 32dd bust, but the seam across the chest was too tight. however i did not have a problem with the armholes, even going down two sizes. i have narrow shoulders, so maybe that",3

216,55,Lovely shirt,"I noticed this top as i was going into the fitting room, and tried it on on impulse. i was pleasantly surprised with the fit and soft quality of the fabric, and even more impressed with the price. i usually like my tops very fitted, and found this one hung loose, but not boxy. i have been wearing it quite a bit, sometimes with a camisole underneath, and sometimes not. i bought the one with the flowers, and it is not see-through, and the light fabric is good for our warm heat. i bought my usual s",0
216,55,Very flattering,I sew and therefore i can tell when something is cut and designed well. this top hangs beautifully and the colors are very pretty. it's cotton.,0
216,56,Another floreat top misses the mark,"I've been shopping at retailer since 2007, and floreat used to be my favorite designer, but for the past year or more, floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model. 
1. it is long on her, not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this, i might try on a size m and give it another chance.
2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this, as mentioned above.
3. in the picture, t",24
216,56,On the fence --- some problems,"The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory, but the top in reality is more beige. well, i'm blonde with fair skin, so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality, with it really being beige, having pleats everywhere, and being a crinkly fabric, it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts",4
216,56,Too short waisted!,"I ordered this top in a 14, my usual size, and it fits fine, but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist, almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange.",11
216,57,"Love, love, love it!",This top fits well as expected for the size. i love the ease of the top and wear it both casually and a bit more dressed up. great styling on the back.,0
216,58,Cute top,I can't believe that i'm the first person to write a review. this top is so cute. i tried it on in a store and loved it. the sales person in the store said that it had been flying out of the store as soon as they got it in. the color and print are pretty. the fabric is sheer and cool and comes with a cami.,16

216,59,Light draping style,"This blouse drapes and floats lightly like a dream. the dark black patterned top is not see-through which means you can easily wear it without having to layer. the length covers past your hips and the pattern is flattering.

the doubled-up buttons makes the blouse unique and it's comfortable enough to wear to work or with jeans from late summer into fall.",3

216,62,"Nice, but odd fit (for me)","I'm thinking that this might be a hit for the petites out there, but it didn't quite work on my long torso. the seam across the bust fell a little too high making the shirt ride up and the sleeve ended at a weird spot (not quite 3/4 sleeves, and also not long sleeves...but there is a band that makes it feel weird). the v-neck in the front is low, but offered full coverage on my 34a bust, but i can see it being pretty revealing on someone better endowed. fabric and color is nice, and it's a prett",6
216,62,Sold on reviews,"After reading many positive reviews i ordered. sure glad i did. i love the light, airy fabric. it hangs nicely. i am mostly a 12, sometimes a 14. i ordered both sizes and the 14 was a perfect fit. i am very pleased with this purchase. thought it might be too girly and/or young looking on me, but not so at all. i got the white and i certainly like the red detail at the button holes too.",0
216,62,The price is right!,"Tried this on a whim in store, and it might not look like much on the hanger, but this beauty fits perfectly and is quite flattering! it is loose without being billowy (still has nice tailoring for shape), the fabric is light but good quality, and the pattern is super cute. i was shocked when i saw that the price was much lower than expected - this is a true win, even at full price. for reference, i'm 5'7"" 128lbs and took my usual size s.",10
216,66,Too bad,"I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors, really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t",4

217,23,Unique sweater/swing dress,"I love this dress. based on reviews, i ordered the small, and the only problem i had was that, while the dress is quite large, the detachable slip lining was quite tight and fitted, which i didn't find comfortable. so i replaced it with a flowy silk slip of my own, and the results are great. the fiber content contains a bit of wool, but i do not find it scratchy to my skin. and i am lovin' the hi-lo aspects of the hem. fun dress for winter!",0
217,24,Great maternity dress,"Another reviewer mentioned this was maternity-ish. i am currently almost 5 months pregnant, and i have to say: this is a wonderful maternity dress, even if that's not what it was made for. when not pregnant, i think this might have been a little overwhelming (and i guess we'll see next year if that's the case for me) -- there is a lot of fabric here. i am usually a small or medium in antrho dresses, and i am wearing a small in this now with room to grow as my stomach grows. the colors on the blu",0

217,25,Simple and versatile,Love the versatility of the dress. very easy to dress either up or down. i've been able to wear it out for a casual day with a denim jacket and booties (just like the stock photo!) or even wear it to work with a black jacket and flats. the color is beautiful and the material is very soft and comfortable. absolutely love the cut and design of the dress on top. only thing i would mention is that the dress is a bit form fitting than expected. it definitely hugs your curves.,0
217,27,"Good idea, poor execution","I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges. but, the first thing that set me off was the color and the material. the color is more street sign yellow than a soft, warm yellow. the fabric is a thin, sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper. i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric. when i tried it on, i liked the idea, but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume...or a parachute. i will defin",1
217,28,Great color options but totally frumpy,"I bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed. i'm 5'7"" and slim. it was matronly. i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better? the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose. the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt. keep that in mind if you do buy. pretty",0

217,33,Awesome dress!,"I got this when it went on sale (in navy and coral colors), awesome dress for any occasion! as far as complaints go about the straps, its meant to be low-cut! i really like the basket weave bodice although that does make it more difficult to zip up, but i found it was easier to just slip the dress on zipped up since the stretchy fabric gives quite a bit rather than deal with the zipper. i normally wear about a 0-2 in most retailer brands and have the dress in both sizes (didn't notice a big differ",0

pros:
- tons of stretch to the top part. i'm a 36c, so a lot of retailer tops are too snug for women with some bust. however, i fit into a medium here without it being too snug. you could actually go down or up depending on how loose or tight you'd like it to be on you.

first, the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style, cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th",0

220,46,Just gorgeous!,"Since there was only one review on this i thought i would chime in. i had been eyeing this for months and was able to get it on sale which was a plus since this had a pretty hefty price tag to start. that being said, the tailoring and detail work on it is just beautiful. i am a little worried about how the knit will wear but not worried enough to return it! as far as sizing goes, i ordered a 4 in the last byron lars dress and i am a 4 in this too. it fits snugly, but a 6 would have looked lumpy",4

220,47,Cute dress for younger women,"First, i must say that this dress fits beautifully in my usual xs (5' 4"", 119 lbs) and the geometric pattern is adorable. i often have a fit problem with dresses (i think due to a long waist) where the fabric bunches up by my lower back. not so with this dress. it shows off my curves without being super tight and the fabric has a little stretch so the dress isn't binding. for my age, however (mid-40s), this dress is just a little too short for the office so i'm sending it back. also, i felt that",4

220,49,Adorable !!!!!,"I just received my dress yesterday and it is gorgeous!!! i actually ordered 2 sizes, 00p and 0p, depending on some cuts i'm between those 2 sizes, i am 5'1 92 lbs but with holidays eating i have gained 4 pounds so far, so the 00p was bit too tight all way from hips to bust area, i was able to zip it up but was a bit painful to keep breathing and got some weird wrinkles on the back between waist line and derriã©re.

220,49,It's a beauty!,"This is a gorgeous dress. it comes with a black silky belt, but mine was too large, which is probably why it is not shown on the model photos. i think maybe it only works if you're on the larger size for the dress. it's very easy to get on and off due to the front zipper. i was worried about bra straps showing on the low cut back, but they actually show more at the broad shoulders. i'm not sure if that's more apparent because i went up on the size to have room at the hips. there is a cute kick p",0
220,49,Love it!,"This is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors. it is form-fitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions - i plan to wear it for my son's graduation, but i think there are many potential uses for this dress. be aware that, like many byron lars sheath dresses, the bottom part is very tight- makes it hard to fit for more pear-shaped people. the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug. however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t",0
220,49,Purchase before this dress sells out!,"The photo of this dress does not do it justice. this dress is absolutely gorgeous. the construction is very high quality. i always worry about peekaboos with button front dresses as i am very busty. total non-issue with this dress. the petite fit is also spot on. it is slightly large in the back bodice for me, but i always have that problem. it's an easy tailoring fix.

one, it isn't a circle skirt, per se, which is good. i am hip heavy and don't need extra volume at my hips. so while it's called a circle skirt, the description states that it's a-line. based on that, i was willing to risk it. also, i am 55 and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths (just my personal preference). although i am only 5'2"" i ordered the regular size 10 for the extra length and it's exactly at my knee; perfect for me.",0

i tried this dress on a whim: and boy am i glad i did. i'm 5'4"", 140lb, 34b with weight carried on the bottom, usually wear a size 4 in fit and flare dresses: the size 2 fit like a glove here.
i'm shocked at just how incredible the lace is: thick, well laid on the base dress fabric, gorgeous without being too 'lacy'. the base fabri",0
223,34,Ah-mazing dress!!,"Just bought this for easter and it fits beautifully! not only is the cut very flattering, but the colors and fabric are perfect for spring!",2
223,34,Beautiful but too bulky in the middle,This is a beautiful dress. i ordered a size 10 to accommodate my bust (36d) which it did but the rest of the dress was too big. it was bulky in the middle area and did nothing for my shape. this would likely work best for smaller ladies.,10
223,34,Beautiful dress,"I purchased this dress in our retailer store. i usually wear either a 0 or 2 petite (5'1"", 115 lbs.). i was able to wear a 0r in this and it fit perfectly. i paired it with a sparkly belt from retailer for a cocktail party and received lots of compliments.",0
223,34,Beautiful flowy dress,"I purchased this dress in ""yellow"" in a size 8 and 10 since i'm between sizes, and the 8 fits like a dream. i love this dress. it's a nice length, hitting just below my knees, and i can pull off strappy sandals as well as wedge heels and it all looks great. i also like that the top is situated so that i can wear a regular bra with it. i was concerned that the pleats would look tacky in person, but they give the dress a nice amount of movement and swing. highly recommend!",4

223,34,Goddess dress,"This dress is so beautiful it makes me feel like a goddess, lol. i'm normally a 10/12 or m/l and took a 12. i think the 10 would have worked too. everything from the colors, fit and flow of the dress is wonderful. i didn't have any problem with there being too much fabric as some of the reviews mentioned.",0

223,35,Awesome dress!,"One of the best maxi dresses i have ever found! i needed a dress that could accommodate a large bust (36g) and camouflage my postpartum belly. the dress did it all. i ordered the large (5'7 and 155 lbs) and it is so flattering. it has just the right amount of coverage up top to prevent looking too busty. and the band around the midsection makes me look much slimmer. like i said, best maxi dress ever. price is pretty high, but it was worth it!",4
223,35,Easy and stylish,,1
223,35,Even more beautiful in person!,"I was on the fence about purchasing this dress for a while and finally took the plunge. glad i did because this dress is stunning and very comfortable. i ordered an xsp and it was the perfect length. originally, i had also considered xxsp. while it fit well above the waist, it was slightly too short. for reference, i'm 5 ft 3.5 inches, 105 pounds.",0

223,36,Bad zipper,"Beautiful dress with the colors and pleats. i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did. my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn&#39;t lay flat, even when just hanging on the hanger. when actually on a person the zipper juts out. had to be returned!",0

223,36,Great in photo... not so much on,"This dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years. unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others. the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women. while the fabric is beautiful, overall the dress did not look like much. disappointed.",0
223,36,"Nice fabric, poor design","This dress has a beautiful fabric, i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering, absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p, i'm 5'5"" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me.",0
223,36,,"I just received this dress in petite extra small. for reference, i am 5""7 and 118 pounds. to answer the previous reviewer's question, the regular size of this dress runs long. if you want it to look like the one in the video, then order it in petite. i personally love the style and the material. however, the inside slip is very short with the petite given my height but this can be solved by adding a half slip underneath it.",1
223,36,,"This dress is beautiful. this is a 0 and tts. it was not clingy or tight at all (5'4"" 115lbs). it is fully lined, and i have short legs, so it was not too short for me. if you have an event you could wear this to this summer, i highly recommend.",12
223,37,Cheap,"This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.",26
223,37,Perfect summer dress,"I love this dress! it is perfect for a wedding, brunch with friends, or even work. it is beautifully made and is comfortable. i have it in the yellow colorway, but i am tempted to go back and purchase it in the purple colorway as well.",0
223,37,,"This dress is extremely comfortable and easy to wear with a bra. the back is great and the length is perfect for me. it's flattering, but the pattern (being light in color across the middle) isn't particularly flattering on your waist. that being said though, the gathering in front is great for hiding bumps and whatnot (after 3 kids that's important to me). lightweight and great for summer. 5'8"", 135lbs and the size s fit perfectly.",10
223,37,,"This is not only comfortable but incredibly flattering. being 6'0"" it's also long enough for me.",5

223,38,Cute maxi,"The material is nice and has a lot of stretch. i ordered the small as i'm a 6 in most dresses. it fits comfortably  i could probably get away with xs but have a large chest so was afraid it wouldn't cover me. i'm 5'2"" so a petite might be a bit better but it was sold out. i'll have to wear tall wedges with this one.",0
223,38,So many compliments,Love this dress. i wore it with black boots and got so many compliments super comfortable.  i feel like this dress will never go out style.,1
223,38,Summer go-to dress!,"This dress is as comfortable as it is adorable. i am 6'2"" and usually wear 12/14 but the 10 fit me. love, love, love this dress!!",3
223,38,What's with the length?,"So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video, the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive, i won't be able to try it on at the store.",11
223,39,Another tracy reese winner,"I can't get enough of maxi dresses and i can't resist tracy reese. this stunning dress caught my eye immediately, but i was worried that the back cut out at the waist would make my backside look flatter. i'm so glad i took the plunge to buy before it sold out. this dress fits perfectly, it's flattering to my figure, the print is beautiful, the fabric and drape do not cling to my figure flaws and i'm just so happy! for sizing reference here are my stats: 5'3"" 140# 36dd and i purchased the medium",6
223,39,Beautiful!!,This dress is so easy to wear! the neck line is not too low! can wear a regular bra!! it flows beautifully! i love it!!,0
223,39,Fell in love years late,"I fell in love with this dress two years after it sold out so i'm so lucky to have gotten my greedy little hands on this eye catching retro modern number. my mom adores the fit on me as it reminds her of her youth in the 50's and 60's. i originally sized down to a 6, not realizing my bust/wide rib cage would make the fit difficult. wish i could have found an 8 but settled for 10p and will have a tailor finish it. i'm also going to remove the tulle layer since i want to wear as more casual frock.",0
223,39,Lovely cut,"And lovely color, just not on my pale skin hue unfortunately. i tried on the xs in store, and that was a little long on me, so i would need petite. the cut was very flattering, and super feminine, i love the color and pattern on the dr4ess too. sadly, not for me, i looked sick in it. (115 lbs, 30 dd and xs petite would fit)",2
223,39,Not my favorite,"Not in love with this one. the fabric is thin and seems cheap... it seems overpriced even on sale. and it runs a bit small along the bust. i could maybe get away with it without a bra, but after 3 kids, braless isn't my best look. and i don't think the print is a pretty in person as it is online - can't quite put my finger on why... maybe a little darker in person. that said, the fit is flattering. the cinched waist is lovely, and the skirt is nice and flowy. even so, this one is going back.",0
223,39,Overall loved but,"As others stated, it was a tad bizarre to have a mock neck on the spring dress, however, i would wear this in the fall with boots and a nice moto jacket. another ""but"" is i wasn't sure about the color. i am very pale and the pale color is pretty much my skin color... however, the blue flowers and black lace make up for it as far as colors, and everyone liked it on me. lastly, cut: wow, this was just really nice on, very flattering,. i usually try on regular size in store and order petite, but th",1
223,39,"Red ""evanthe"" dress","Agreed with the previous reviewer, this is the same dress as the evanthe dress that came out this summer, but in a rich beautiful red/wine color. the color differences in the pattern are , however, more subtle than the summer version, remaining in one palette. yo u can't tell from the picture, but the back is longer than the front. the neckline is very flattering, i found this one a little more snug than the evanthe (around the rib cage), tried on 00p (size for evanthe) might be better as 0p in",1
223,39,Too many pleats,There were just too many pleats to this thing. it was not flattering. it looks fantastic on this model but not on me. oh well.,2
223,39,Unexpected delight,I wasn't expecting to love to this dress as much as i do.  the length and horizontal stripes (petite was sold out and my torso is square) are automatically two strikes but the sale-on-sale price was begging me to give it a go.  so glad i did!  the cut and flare are flattering.  the self to tie is slimming and can be styled different ways.  the regular length is doable when i wear platform wedges.  the colors scream summer and vacation fun.  my only problem is the feel of the fabric--liner is fin,2
223,39,Very well made but waistline sits high,"After seeing how this looked on model in the picture i had a feeling it might be not only a bit short but also high waisted. so i took a chance and ordered a regular size 2. i am 5'1 115lbs, so i typically order a petite 2. received this today and am very happy i made that choice. the waistline hits where it should and the skirt hit right at my knees. the fabric is perfect for winter. i was actually surprised at the weight of the dress when i pulled it from the box - it was very heavy. the lace",2

223,40,Small-chested women need not apply,"Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.",0
223,40,The maxi dress i've been looking for,"The first reviewer summed up many of my thoughts exactly. i don't like to go without a bra and this dress with its slightly wider, almost cap-sleeve straps solves my problem perfectly. i love this neckline and wish i'd see it in more maxi dresses! the crossover and cutouts in the back mimic the lines of a traditional indian sari blouse and skirt, again without sacrificing bra coverage. just a beautiful and inspired design - definitely a standout in the sea of summer maxi dresses i've seen. i lov",17
223,40,,"Quite possibly, one of the most flattering, beautiful, and effortlessly romantic dresses i have ever tried on. and, to top it off, it has a sweet surprise: the silk slip on the inside of the dress has the same print as the outside shell, and it is so lovely, that if you feel like wearing something short and sweet, you can wear the slip as its own dress.

223,66,True to description - lovely details,"This is a lovely embroidered (hard to see in the pictures) shift that i purchased to wear to a fancy fundraiser. it has vintage '60s lines that are fun. very forgiving fit. i am 5'5"" 125 lbs with a 32dd bust and purchased a 4 petite (for a great price!!!). i might alter it so it has a bit of a waist curve, but that is minor.",0

224,22,Really cute vest,"I saw this vest at my local retailer store over the weekend and decided to try it on. i am typically an xs at retailer and the xs fit perfectly. i can't wait to wear this during the spring and summer. it's really lightweight and soft which i love. i purchased the copper color, and would consider the color in the photo to be very true. this was definitely a splurge, but i am overall very happy with my purchase. i highly recommend it!",11

224,24,Plaid bomb pairs fabulous with everything fall!,"I had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations! it literally pairs great with everything fall.. chokers, boots, dresses; you name it! it also fits very true to size. not too fit to your body, and a little loose, but not too loose.. just like a bomber jacket should! i highly recommend this product.",1
224,25,Perfect light jacket for fall/spring,"This jacket is exactly what i was looking for! it is a lightweight and comfortable material that will be perfect for fall/spring (and for layering during a mild winter!). i am 5'3, 128 lbs, and generally wear a small - but i ordered a medium in this jacket and am happy i sized up. the jacket is roomy, but the cinched waist makes it flattering rather than shapeless. i'd definitely recommend this anorak to anyone!",0
224,26,Fun spring accessory,"This vest is adorable! i love the color, it goes well with almost anything. the drawstrings work great, some days i cinch them a little tighter for a more fitted look. honestly, i wear it at least once a week - out with friends or even to my job as a nanny. i was a little worried about the length of it because i'm tall, but it works perfectly with my build.",0

224,33,,Just bought this weekend and had to size down. i'm usually a small in jackets and went with the xs. retailer has had this style for the last few years and i've missed out so finally was able to buy before they sold out!! well worth the price point. i think it will be a very versatile jacket. for sizing reference i'm 5'7 and 135lbs.,4
224,34,Great cozy sweater,"I initially bought the red and blue sweater in a medium. i usually wear a large and the medium fits perfectly and is still a bit baggy. i'm tall (5'9"") and so i love the length of the sleeves when they are unrolled. it's a very versatile piece. with sleeves rolled down you can fold the collar so the red is out of sight and just have a navy blue sweater. either look is nice. i loved it so much i bought the black and brown version. also, the fabric doesn't feel thick but it is very insulating and",0
224,34,Great vest!,"I have another sanctuary vest similar to this one and decided i needed to snag this one in the moss green. it's so pretty and it's extremely versatile. i'm 8 months pregnant and it's been a fun vest to wear over a tank with a necklace. i can see this piece working for all seasons. if the other color would have been available, i would have grabbed it, especially at the sale price. you can't beat it! the only downside to this vest is that compared to my other medium sanctuary vest, this one is a b",0
224,35,Can't stop wearing it,"I'm 5'1"", <100 lbs. xs fits surprisingly well. the sleeves were rolled up when it arrived so i didn't noticed they were long. the wrinkled appearance looks fun and casual. 

the big drawback is that the interior seams poke and scratch my skin when i wore it over a halter top. even over a tee it was irritating in one spot. despite that, love it enough to keep.",4
224,39,,"Confused and a little disappointed because the s is too tight in my shoulders and the m is too big all around.  weird because i'm a 39"" chest+breasts so m shouldn't look that baggy on me.  please sanctuary, make a petite version, maybe that will solve my issue.  otherwise, this jacket is soft and relaxed and has no distracting collar.  price point is bit over indulgent for what it is combined with my issues.  who knows, maybe i'll try again?!?",3
224,40,Cute style but runs big!,"I have been on the hunt for a replacement cargo jacket for about a year now. i thought this one was going to be it!! ordered it right away. i got it in an xl as retailer coats always seem to run small on me (i am very busty so sometimes the more fitted styles won't even close without a big gap). this is not the case with this jacket. it runs really big - it looks like it could be an xxxl...but the design is great with a zipper and button closures, pockets and cute back cut...the color is slightly",2

224,43,Great transitional jacket,"This is a great lightweight jacket. i really like the olive color as it goes with so many things. it can be worn with dresses or skirts which is what i mainly wear. i'm an anti-pant person. the only downside is the price. it's a nice stylish jacket, but not sure it warrants the high price tag. it also doesn't look to great buttoned up; has to be worn open. i do recommend it though.",0
224,45,My new fave!,"This jacket is perfect! the crop length is just right! not to short and the way it is cut longer in the back it really paints a beautiful silhouette on my larger frame. i'm a a 12 typically but broad in the shoulders and larger in the bust 36dd. this jacket is loose fitting and roomy. i could probably have gone with a large, but i'm really happy with the xl as i can layer underneath and it's just super roomy and comfy. the quality of this jacket is great. it will be a staple for years to come. i",4

224,53,Great twist on a cargo jacket,"What a unique twist on the traditional cargo jacket! the swing styling on this jacket is so cute---not too full-, you still get a nice silhouette from the front, with the swing in the back this is a fresh take on this staple. it will be a ""go-to"" piece in my closet!! the quality of the material and tailoring on the jacket is wonderful!!! as other reviewers have commented, it does run large. i am exchanging it for a size down. i can't wait to get it in and wear it!",0

it is so soft & comfortable on; i love olive as it goes with everything; it can be super casual or dressier depending upon what you're wearing. i also like that it is collarless as that better allows for a wrapped scarf. i will use this jacket a lot.",5
224,61,Soft and flattering,"What a great little find. it is so soft, and the color blends with everything. a great way to get a few more weeks out of your summer sleeveless dresses, and ease into fall. great with t shirts and pants as well.the collar is flattering over any neckline. it also looks great as a shirt. it really can be worn all year round. i usually wear a size six on top, as ""my girls"" are large. the medium was a perfect fit. and there was no billowing in the back. worth the price, as it will become a go to ja",0

226,23,Perfectly feminine,"This dress makes you feel like a little kid. it certainly helps that it is an excellent twirling dress, for sure. i wish it had a little more definition to the waist--it just barely works for larger chested women, definitely on the line from being a little too baby doll shapeless. the colors are so beautiful and the fabric so light that it's hard to pass this one up. it's just too beautiful. i recommend it, but it's probably not for everyone.",3

226,27,Exquisite!,"This is one of those rare garments that is actually as flattering on me as it looks on the model. just like the picture, it hangs like a dress and emphasizes my curves without seeming too revealing. the weight of the fabric creates graceful movement, while the loose cut keeps it cool and breezy. for reference, i am 5'4"" and curvy (34d, 35x28x39), and i ordered a small petite. this is a smaller size than i would wear in most styles, but it fits almost like it was made for me. the tie hits slightl",3
226,27,Extremely flattering and comfortable,"Love love love! i'm 5'8"", 122 lbs, 34b, and have an athletic frame (fairly narrow hips) and i bought an xs (in red.) usually i am a s with retailer for dresses (although occasionally a m for slimmer dresses), but i found that the top part of this dress required me to size down to an xs as the low back-design of the dress fit too loosely with the size s--it hung so that it showed my bra straps and the sleeves were a tad baggy under the arms, showing about 2"" of bra underneath. my guess is that if y",57
226,27,Flimsy material,"I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin. i was expecting higher quality, especially for the price. i was disappointed. it is a pretty dress and fit great, but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper.",2
226,27,Great fit. wrong color.,,10
226,27,My new favorite summer dress,"This dress is so much more stunning in person than in the photos. it's incredibly flattering, and i like how it pans out at the bottom. it also has pockets! although it has a built-in slip, it is a little see-through, so keep that in mind, otherwise, i can't wear it enough.",1
226,27,Not for tall hourglass body types,"I was bummed about this dress! i saw it online and loved both colors. i tried it on in the store, and it did not work for me. i am 5'8"" tall with an hourglass figure, and it was too shot and too loose. it looked like a babydoll nightgown. i wanted to love it, but i think this one only works on smaller frames. onto the next...",0
226,27,Perfection,This dress is amazing. bought in orange and fits wonderfully. great quality and could transition in between seasons,8
226,27,,I wear an xxs petite and this dress was still large. i like that look so i'm okay with that but the sides do stick out a little bit if you have a smaller frame.,1
226,28,"Beautiful color, great quality",Just received this dress and i am in love! the colors are beautiful- perfect for both summer and fall. the fabric is very soft and the fringe detail adds a nice feminine touch. i was disappointed when i missed out on the first fringe stripe shift dress from holding horses at the beginning of this summer. it was completely sold out in my size 0. however when i saw they restocked the dress in a new color (and now lined yay!) i had to buy it. would defin recommend!!,4
226,28,Beautiful maxi!,"I ordered this in the neutral motif and the colors and design are more beautiful in person. unfortunately, there were no ""petites"" available when i ordered so i will have to have the length and slit tailored.",0
226,28,Cute and stylish,"This is so cute...i love the stripe and fringe combo.  i took my typical size, 4. kind of short for a 5'7 frame, but love otherwise.",0
226,28,Cute but very short,"Very cute and high-quality dress but it is very short. the length wouldn't be that much of an issue except for the fringe (which is awesome and unique, by the way) hits right at the butt. wish this dress (and, subsequently the fringe) was 3 inches longer.",1
226,28,Does not hang well,"I am typically a small/6 in dresses, but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down. it had no shape, but hung like a paper sack. the armholes fit perfectly though, if i had sized down they may have been too tight. i am 5'6"" 140 lb
i will return, too bad because it is a pretty dress!",0
226,28,"Drab color, weird fit","Couldn't make it work, even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan, like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all, just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust), then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy, curvy waist, but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape. (5'3'' 127lb 34a, tried xs)",0
226,28,Faulty zipper problem,"I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite, one 00. the style, color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall, however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot, both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this.",22
226,28,Love this fabric!,The sleeves are fitted which i love. works with a belt or without.,0
226,28,"Nice print, not flattering for me","Loved the print on this dress, however the fit wasn't for me.  i feel like it exaggerated my belly, and just overall i didn't feel great in it.  the sleeves were also really big.",1
226,28,Super casual and comfortable,"I love this dress! it is a very casual and loose fit, which makes it super comfortable. i highly recommend it since it is versatile for fall and spring and can be styled quite a few ways.",1
226,28,Whimsical romper,"A fun, casual romper. i loved the pink color (not usually my thing), which looks great with darker skin. like another reviewer said, the waist is quite small so i would recommend sizing up one or two sizes (i took a size 6 in this, but am usually a 2/4) - this will make the top part a bit blousy, but i think that adds to the appeal/ look.",5
226,28,Wife loves it,Got this for my wife for christmas and she is very happy with it. the size is perfect for her and she regularly orders things as a medium from this store.,2
226,29,Adorable spring time dress!,Thank goodness i looked at everyone's reviews beforehand because i ordered a size up (4) and it fits perfectly. i am usually a size 2 but can definitely tell it wouldn't have fit correctly had i ordered a 2. the orange color works well for either a fall dress with leggins or a spring dress by itself. i love it!,0
226,29,Classic,"In retailer dresses the petites usually fit me better, i'm short, but this regular fit well. looks super cute, i've gotten so many compliments on it. comfortable, and the pockets are always nice.",0
226,29,Comfy!,"Love that this is comfy, with a subtle yet sexy vibe. had so many compliments when i wore this to work, with everyone asking where i got it! fits true to size (110lb, 5'4"") and xs fit perfect. took off a star because it may look like it could get that ""fuzzy"" pilling over time.",0
226,29,Cute but runs large,"I was really hoping this dress would work out, as it looks like it could be a staple outfit for work! the material is very nice, but unfortunately the dress was way too big. there is a band right under the chest that i would think should be somewhat fitted to give the dress some shape to your figure, but it was wayyy to big on me (especially considering i am large-chested! i will be returning this.",0
226,29,Disappointed--will return,"I ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed. as other reviewers have mentioned, the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures. the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person. 
as for sizing, i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers' comments about it running small. the 2p fit me fine, although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested #32b#. i can definitely see that being an issue",1
226,29,Love this dress!!!,"Saw this in store today and had to have it. the pink is a really bright pink - definitely more of a hot pink than it appears in the image online. i am a solid 10, and i bought this in an 8, so it definitely runs a size large. highly recommend!",3
226,29,Perfect if you have curves,"I ordered this dress the instant it appeared online, hoping that 'tangerine' would mean red, and not orange. and, what luck! it was the perfect red for my coloring - nothing orange or bricky, it was a true red. the background color is actually a deep navy, but it looks almost black in some angles. the fabric is super comfortable. it's long enough for work, easy and fun enough for a date, and perfect for spring-summer months. 

my only problem with it is the top is too large. i am a 34-a, 5ft-3",4
226,29,So cute and comfortable!,"I'm 5'5"" and got the m. i thought i'd need the petite but i decided to try on the regular m in the store and the length was fine (mid calf). i gave a 3 for quality though because all the ones in my store were tearing in the back where the shoulders meet the back. i bought it anyway because it looked like an easy fix and it was so darn cute and comfortable on!",2
226,29,Too much fabric,,1
226,29,,"I bought this dress online to wear to work and i did not expect anything too impressive based on the picture of the model. i am really surprised at how beautiful, well-fitting, and soft this dress is. i am in love. it fits snugly, but the fabric is so thick that it is still very office appropriate (i work at a law firm). i ordered the small petite and it comes to the top of my knees.",0
226,29,,,0
226,30,Beautiful! careful with the sizing though,"This dress is gorgeous! i absolutely love the embroidery. a note about the sizing- while the top portion fits snugly, the hip section runs slightly big. i was surprised to find that the 4 i ordered looked baggy, so i went into the store to try a 2, but the 0 was the best fit! however i'm small-chested (and 5'6"" 113lbs), so i was able to go with the 0 as it fit the hips much better. if you're a bustier type though, the top may be tight. other than the tricky sizing, it's perfect.",0
226,30,Cute but arrived dirty,"Cute dress- flattering and seems to be well made. however, when i received it it seemed that it had been worn. the bottom was all dirty and it had a white mark at the top. called and rep said they would send new dress if i send first back, so hopefully that gets here quickly and in good shape. the other dress i place with my order hasn't even shipped and the rep couldn't tell me when/if it would.",0
226,30,Cuter on the model,"No, no, no...i don't know if it was the way it got flattened out in the packaging, or what, but it sticks out like a tent from the hips down. i'm 5'7"", about 145, 32c, usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. this thing barely buttoned over my bust, and then flares out to a tent-like triangular shape at the bottom. i don't think it would come out by washing and ironing it; i'm afraid it was just cut poorly. i looked like a sad prisoner in stripes, unfortunately. i bought three different dresses in the",2
226,30,"Ehhh... it's fine, i guess.","When you buy a dress full price and it goes on sale before you can even wear it ($168 down to $49) uuuuggghhh... i like the dress fine enough, but it has a weird under wire, it makes my chest look strange, like i don't fill it in. i usually don't have that problem as a c cup. more orange/red then yellow as well. wouldn't recommend.",0
226,30,Impossible to put on,"The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on, but the top is very poorly designed. it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back. you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear. once i got it on, it fit perfectly though. getting out of it was a disaster. i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip. overall, i was crushed that it didn't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering.",1
226,30,,Beautiful dress; i ended up getting it in both the red and the green. the fit is absolutely perfect and it flatters pretty much any figure. one thing i would say is that you should get your exact size if possible; i ordered it online because it was so pretty in the 4p. i happened to be in the store the next week and i ttried on the 4r in the store just to see how it looked and it was awful! i was so disappointed but then my dress arrived in the mail and the 4p fit me perfectly. i'm so glad retailer,0
226,30,,,0
226,31,Beautiful and flattering,"This dress is very comfortable, very flattering and just lovely. my only critique is that the skirt is more rust colored in real life, where on the website it looks more red. and the bodice looked a bit more peach/pink in the picture. still a beautiful, interesting, well made and extremely comfortable dress. thanks retailer! i am 5'9, 155# and the m is great.",0
226,31,Beautiful color and fabric,"I really like the soft, flowy satin fabric and vibrant color of this dress! i am 5'5'' 125lbs, the s was too large, so i ordered the xs instead. things to note: pockets, elastic waistband with nice detailing on the sides, slip underneath, and large flutter sleeves. i think that women with smaller torsos should consider petite sizing.",5
226,31,"Beautiful, but does not fit as pictured","Saw this dress in the blue motif and thought it would be perfect for a summer outdoor wedding. i'm 5'4"" 125 lbs and ordered a size 2. it fit true to size in the shoulders, bust and length, but did not fit as pictured on the site; it looks in the pictures like there is some shape to the waistline without being too fitted, which i like. on me there was absolutely no shape. it just billowed and looked really maternity. 15 bucks for alterations to take in the sides and now it's my favorite darn thin",0
226,31,Comfy and flattering,"Perfect fit. this dress is super flattering, the criss-crossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on. the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage. the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty! the perfect spring to summer dress!",0
226,31,Cute but . . .,"This dress is adorable. the color is on the red orange side and is nice for the summer. the cotton is also nice and light. however, the bust is cut short and the skirt is unforgiving to girls with hips. if you have b/c cup or less and do not have an hour glass figure then this dress may be for you.",0
226,31,Detailed and classy,,0
226,31,Flowy and comfy,"I was a little afraid to order this dress online but my local store only had a small left, so i jumped hoping the fabled net would appear, and it did. this might be my favorite retailer dress thus far. i ended up buying a large due to the fear of the front being too short, it was a good call. i'm sure a medium would have fit up top but i have longer legs and i know i wouldn't have felt comfortable in a medium's length. plus i tend to like the oversized look. i paired it with some slouchy socks and",0
226,31,For the shorter girls,"I really wanted to love this dress, but it was so short! i'm only 5'6"" so i don't consider myself really tall, but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt! way too short for me. my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha. but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter. or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt :)",4
226,31,Love,"Super cute, flowy, and flattering. i would buy again in a heartbeat.",0
226,31,Perfect!,This dress is super flattering. i love everything about it!,1
226,31,Pretty but not for tall ladies,Loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front. the slip was also slightly tight over hips. i wish this was longer!,1
226,31,We need more vintage retailer style.,"The print on this dress harkens to the old days of retailer. if you miss the fun prints and whimsical styles, playful textures, and conversational pieces - this dress is for you! at 5'7"", 34c, 27-28 waist, i bought the size 4. runs tts. site claims it's a fit and flare but i think it's more of a sheath cut. the thicker canvas like material has stretch but gives good form. i wear mine as a jumper/pinafore with a white shirt sleeve blouse. my only complaint is that - as a dress - the arm holes are a",3

226,31,,"The dress is  very feminine and very flirty. i love orange/melon-colored dresses. this one does not disappoint. it does run extremely small around the rib cage. i had to size up to a 6 when i typically wear a 2 or 4. my bra size is 32 b. nice quality fabric, lined, with built-in bustier.",1

226,32,Bring back the turquoise please!!,"I have this in darker blue and it is my favorite dress of the season. i didn't realize that there was one in turquoise until it was already sold out. please bring back or be so kind to contact me if an xs comes in as a return, etc. 
i love this so much!",0
226,32,Fell apart before my eyes,"Was excited to wear the dress for the first time. but while standing in front of the mirror putting makeup on, the seam between the body and sleeve just started to unravel. strangest thing - just a random hole appeared :(.",0
226,32,Had to return,"I loved this dress and it fit perfectly. i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight, and i am really curvy. i did however have a problem trying to take it off. it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back. i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too. i tried to take it off more delicately but i couldn't. maybe it was me, but this dress is too much hassle. if i went any highe",2
226,32,Literally unwearable.,"I purchased this in-store in a vivid red color, but didn't try it on until i got home. big mistake! literally the first time i tried to zip the dress, the cheap, horrible zipper noted in previous reviews just...broke. midway up, right under the waist tie. i was trapped in the dress for a good 15 minutes and was scared i'd have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it; eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape. can't wait to return this asap.",6
226,32,Love this dress!,I love this dress! i generally wear size 10 and the medium fits perfect. i'm a curvy lady and this dress fits great. i've received many compliments on it and might even get another pattern because i love it so much!,5

226,32,,"This is the perfect summer dress. it can be dressed up or down. the quality of the linen fabric is very nice. i'm 5'1"" and it hit right below my knees. i found it to run true to size. those with a smaller bust might want to go down a size, but the tie in the front can be adjusted. it's lovely.",2

226,33,"Beautiful, unique dress",I bought this dress on super sale online after seeing it in the store. the pattern is just so beautiful and unique! i think it looks much pretty in person than online. there isn't a lot of shape to the dress but i like the loose style and can see this being worn with boots/booties. it also looks nice with a belt! my only complaint is i had to size down to a 6 (usually an 8-10 in dresses) and the liner slip was a little tight. also would have loved to try this in petite. the regular falls to just,1
226,33,Better than expected,"After seeing an influx of this dress in my instagram feed i decided to go ahead and purchase it last weekend. i'm usually leery with the length of swing dresses, for instance the endora swing dress (paper crown) is a touch too short for my taste in petite sizing. either way, i decided to go ahead and purchase this dress in petite considering no previous reviews mentioned the length of the dress to be an issue.

226,33,Classy and comfy,I love this dress! it was a tad long ( i'm a shorty) but i loved the cut and versatility of the material/ design that i took it to the tailor. now it is perfect! i wore it to an engagement party but i could see it going very casual or very high end depending on styling. love.,0
226,33,Couldn't send it back fast enough!,"Unlike the other two reviews , i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame, so it was just so overwhelming, the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my",8
226,33,"Cute, but cheap","When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package, and i should have noticed and returned it, but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well, it wasn't, and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly.",0

i picked this up on a whim to try on and i am glad i did. it is very flattering on my curvy frame. it does run a big big so i sized down to a 4 instead of my normal size 6. the top is still a tad bit big as another commented- not enough that i would need to have it altered but enough that i probably wouldn't wear it to work without a cami under it. over all i love this dress. its very flattering and flirty and it makes me feel pretty! i bought the orange motif",3
226,33,Great transitional dress!,"After reading the reviews, stating that this dress was a tent and only fit for the tall and small chested, i kind of had a battle of wills in my head over ordering it. it is very ""me,"" but me is also 5'5, curvy, and possessing a 36g bust. i had to post a review, because i received the dress today, and i actually love it. i ordered a 16 and i love the fit. i know it's flowy, but on me, it's far from tent-like. i think it's great now as a pre-fall piece with some sandals and a jean jacket, and as",2

this dress is soft, comfortable, classy, and has the unique feature of having a low-cut back. my only complaint is that the holes for the arms droop sometimes so reveal my bra. this could be from my shape, however, because i am rather busty. the dress runs true to size and is easy to clean. it's one o",0
226,33,I want to wear this everyday!,"This dress is so soft and comfortable. great winter staple. i purchased the blue motif, which really doesn't have any blue on it. the stripes are fun and make this the perfect dress to throw on and feel great while staying comfortable.",0

226,33,Interesting,"This dress did end up working out for me. however i am very narrow in my chest and shoulders and i can see how it would be too tight on anyone with a med-lrg chest and/or broad shoulders. the fabric is light weight, nice for summer. it will need to be ironed and will wrinkle easily but it still looks well made to me. the slip is smaller than the dress but i feel that the dress is supposed to be ""drapey"". i kept it.",3

226,34,Such high hopes!,"I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight, it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said, i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to, where i lo",0
226,34,Too boxy but nice idea,"This dress did not work well on my figure. i have a small waist and broad hips, and the dress (size m for 140 lbs, 5'8"") was too boxy. i didn't have objections to the fabric, like other reviewers - honestly, even if there were a snag or two, the fabric is kind of rustic and i don't think a snag would look terrible, depending on where it is. i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival. my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f",0
226,34,Where is the slip!?,"Was excited to receive this dress as i got it at a great price on sale. the colors are great and it fits pretty good, but it came without a slip!!  so disappointing to not receive the entire dress!!  hence the 2 stars. may send it back for this reason.",0
226,34,,"The pattern is very cute!  from the front i liked it, but when i turn to the side, you can see just how voluminous it is.  it ended up looking a bit tenty.  if it had just a bit more shape it would be perfect.  in the end, not the most flattering.",0
226,34,,This dress is great! i purchased the navy colorway. it is really soft and the fabric flows nicely. i was lucky enough to snag this on sale so i couldn't beat the price. i like the buttons on the sleeves. it adds just a cute special touch. i'm 5'3 and this hits me right at the knee.,0
226,35,Beautiful dress,"Beautiful dress, stretch material makes sure it fits the figure nicely. great value.",0
226,35,Beautiful lace dress - size up,I love this dress's gentle blue lace. the silhouette is just as seen in the pictures. i found the dress tight in the chest and had to size up one size (6 to 8).,0
226,35,Beautiful pattern,"This dress is true to size and great for the winter months. it's very comfortable and not scratchy at all. i love the colors and patterns on this dress. the buttons are a nice detail, but after wearing this dress twice, one of the buttons has already fallen off. they don't seem to be sewn securely. i am tall and this dress falls as shown on the model.",0
226,35,Big blue sack,"This dress hangs like a sack. it really needs a belt to give it some shape. i tried to style it with one, but then didn't look right either. i did like the slip that came with it. i'll be returning it.",0
226,35,Cheaply made,"The cut and color of the dress is awesome. however, the biggest flaw is the zipper. i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke..sad day especially at the price. there also were a number of loose threads. i recommend waiting until it goes on sale. you'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper.",2
226,35,Confortable,"I wanted something for the hot summers here, and this fits the ticket. very lightweight and airy. it's somewhat of a strange design, short in the front, hitting an inch or two above the knee, but the back is unusually long. the lining is awkward, and kind of tight and difficult to get into. the material is very thin, and although i haven't noticed any strings or unraveling like other reviewers, it's not the highest quality. overall the dress is nice and lightweight, but not the greatest quality",0
226,35,"Cute, but something is off","I am short (5'3"") and very curvy. i usually get petite in dresses. something about this fit was strange. it was definitely a little shorter than most petites. the lace detail on the front of this dress is really cute and it is a color you don't see often so i kept it.",3
226,35,Effortless for summer,"Caught my eye at checkout, and had to run back to the dressing room for a quick try-on, which ended up being a great call! the dress is super easy and flattering, as the lining keeps it skimming over my hourglass shape. the fabric has a sweet floral texture, and the gathering takes a basic shape and makes it interesting. i'm 5'4"" and it came just above the knee in front, while the back was a bit longer (another flattering feature). this is going to be a summer go-to!",3
226,35,Gorgeous dress,I purchased this in the black in an xl. i am typically a 14-16 dress size and i would say this runs tts with a flowing fit on the bottom. the top is fitted but has some stretch to it. absolutely gorgeous fit and quality. i love this so much i want to purchase the teal color. a spring must have!!!,34
226,35,"Great concept, but...","I really wanted to love this, but the length of the pants was so awkward and dowdy. if they were longer or shorter, this would be a win. nice fabric, not too clingy so it is attractive on top and hips.",1
226,35,"Great print, awkward cut","I tried this dress on in the store, prepared to buy this lovely piece. i feel that it should have been a few inches longer, it would look more proportionate. next, the tie is really difficult to place, but it creates some great detail to the front and back. it wrinkles easily, i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear. lastly it is not lined, what a bummer, at least the skirt could be lined. but, it does have pockets, that is sweet.",3
226,35,Horrible,"I cannot imagine this dress working in any size. i am a small, thin and average height woman (usually a 25/26 in pants, a size 32c bust, and 5'6"" tall). this dress was huge. i sized down to a 2 ( i am always a 4 in dresses) and this dress was still big... i do not know if i could size down to a 0 though as the shoulders seemed to fit right. it was ginormous. i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be 3 months pregnant, it still wouldn't work unless i was 9 months pregnant and carrying tr",2
226,35,I'm confused,"Let me start with: i love this dress --- but i'm totally confused. there is a pleat in the center of the dress, which if you look at the first photo on retailer's website, you can see that the model has the pleat in front, but when i recieved the dress, the tag is on the pleat side, meaning if you put the pleat in front, you're wearing it backwards. then other pictures show the model with no pleat in front, i tried it both ways and neither way felt wrong --- i thought it would fit funny if i flipp",0

226,35,Not amazing,"Not a huge fan of this dress, will be returning it.

226,35,Super comfortable and cute,"I didn't notice what some of the other reviews have said. i think it's very flattering, makes my waist look tiny and the flouncy skirt is a lot of fun. it is low cut in the bust, but not crazy. i'm a modest person and i'm comfortable with it. what i like best however it the cut of the top. it is wide enough at the arms to cover any armpit bulge! the fabric is very light and soft and the colors are vibrant and fun. it does run a tad large. i can go between a 2 and 4 in most retailer dresses and got",2
226,35,"Take car with it, but it's gorgeous","I love this dress. i agree with the other reviewers that the rhinestone linkages do very easily get caught on the lace part of the dress and i could see it snagging very quickly. that said, i am going to keep it and hope for the best because it is absolutely gorgeous. it is not actually a true white as it looks pictured. instead we, it is more of a nude color, but it adds to the flattering nature of the dress and makes it look sheer. the embroidery is beautiful. my only complaint is that it will",8

226,36,Cute dress but terrible design flaw,"I purchased this dress yesterday and it's cute and fits great, but the embroidery across the back ripped as soon as i moved my arms. it's really delicate and strains anytime you lift your arms overhead or forward. i'm keeping it anyway because the supersoft pretty slip that come with it is worth the sale price.",0

226,36,Great transition dress,"Very charming, well made and comfortable. it is a heavier material with a slip so it's a great spring dress if you have cooler days but i could see in the summer if you have 80f + temps it could be a little warm. i have a 34c/d chest and i didn't find it too snug like the other reviewer. pretty tts for maeve.",4
226,36,"If you make one purchase this spring, buy this!","Maeve does not disappoint! unlike many of the tops and dresses which recently have been billowy, a bit shapeless, and not form-fitting, this hugs all the right curves. it's adorable, eye-catching and the pattern is so cute. i paired it with nude heels today and a jacket - so fun. just like the wynwood top in all 4 colors, the level of fun and playfulness is unmatched. it's tts. i am 5'4"" 115 and got the 2. thank you, retailer & thank you, maeve!",0

226,36,Must have summer dress for any occasion!,"This dress looks way better on you than sitting on the hanger! the design really flatters your body and the waist area, makes you look very skinny! highly recommend! the length is also perfect, just the right length for a maxi dress, long enough but short enough to show off your shoes as well!",3

226,36,Striking dress!,"Based on reviewers' comments, i sized up and ordered an 8 (normally i run 4-6). and while the waist fit pretty well, the bust was too large and roomy (i'm a34b bust). i eventually got ahold of a 6 and the waist still fits and the bust is much better. so for me, at least the two dresses i got are true to fit. and the dress is very pretty and i'm excited to wear it!!!....i guess since it's fall i may have to wait until next year...",0
226,36,Stunning,"This one is a beauty! my store is not carrying the white - they had a lovely blue (periwinkle-ish) that immediately caught my eye. the ivory model shot makes the details of the lace and top layer really pop - more so than the blue variety but both are stunning. the details and layers on this dress are lovely and intricate without feeling overly delicate. quality most definitely in line with the price.

226,37,Beautiful dress!,"I specifically bought this dress for my bridal shower and loved it! i'm small on top and have hips that don't lie. i purchased the size 2 petite. the waist portion of the dress came up a little higher which was ok since it fell at a small part of my waist. the length was just above my knee, which i prefer. the dress has a nude lining which compliments my tan skin tone. i wore a regular nude bra that didn't show beneath the liner. i received many compliments and would highly recommend it.

226,37,Not impressed,"After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean, but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly, the top has a strange transition to the skirt, with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat, it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks, creating less clean lines. i also found the blue, black",0
226,37,Not quite,I like the idea of this but had to return it. the fitted liner is attached at shoulders and awkward to get into. the shirt is too poofy. didn't flatter short and curvy.,0
226,37,Small in bust,I ordered this dress in the blue color. it is lovely in person - but the petite seemed to run smaller than most petite dresses i buy from retailer. i ordered a 2p - and it was tight in the bust on me. i imagine a 4p would be perfect. i am 117 5'3 34b.,1
226,37,Stunning,"I&#39;ve been eyeing this dress for weeks. finally i took the plunge and bought it! the velvet is gorgeous and the style is fun and playful. i know many of the reviewers said it was running large, but i had to order an xl because i nearly got stuck in the l (no stretch). im normally a size 16 and carry most of my weight in my stomach butt and hips. definitely more of a shift than a swing. however its still just lovely. looking forward to paring it with a kimono for a wedding tomorrow!",0
226,37,Too billowy,I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it's a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass.  had to send it back.,0
226,37,Very comfortable,"I love this dress, it's very comfortable, slim swing and very ingratiating. the fabric is light, i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves. overall, i'm pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress. i will definitely recommend it.",0

226,38,So disappointed!,The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul,6

the cut is well fitted at the waist, elastic band. i will say, however, that it was almost hard to pull the shoulders over (doesn't unbutton past waist). fabric is soft and flowey, length on the regular was mid-though for me, i am a tad oder, so it was nice... if i were younger, i would get petite.

226,43,"Wrinkly cotton, nice shape","While the cut, drape, and shape of this dress are very attractive, seeing the fabric in person was disappointing to me. it's clearly well-made and there are abundant high-quality details. however, the combination of a large-ish pattern and the wrinkly, thin cotton still felt kind of limp and cheap. i sent it back.",0

226,44,Beautiful dress,This dress is really stunning - can be dressed up or down with a jean jacket really easily. runs quite a bit small in the bust (i ordered a 16 to accommodate) but it is really very pretty. i love this brand- they always have such lovely pieces.,3
226,44,Classic and comfort,"This dress is gorgeous yet sturdy, it is all about the lace. size regular 4 fit my chest area well and i like the midi look (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). whether regular or petite size, when i walked or turned, the pleats added too much volume and looked overwhelming and no shape. i tried it with a belt and it looked better, but looked odd because the pleats poofed at the belt area. i tried with a sweater, jacket...then finally gave up. it would look gorgeous on a tall thin gal.",0
226,44,Confirmed: a tent,"I should have listened to previous reviewers. but the dress looks so good on the model in the two dimensional pictures. when it arrived in the mail, i realized this is a mistake. it has no shape, material is poofy and feels cheap. it is going back.",1
226,44,Defective!,"I wanted to love this dress. i saw it in the catalog in blue, and wanted it. however, for some reason i took my sweet time in ordering it, and by the time i did, only the orange was available: but on sale. i was so excited when it arrived, and as i was trying it on, i thought, this is a bit shorter in the skirt than i usually go but it's so pretty... and then i couldn't get my right arm in the sleeve at all. i wondered if i had caught some of the lining as i was putting it on or something, but n",2
226,44,Forget-me-not!,"This dress is extremely feminine. the liner is the unsung hero here: it's cleverly designed to be fitted because on a windy day and the dress flies up, it's a saving grace; it has snap buttons and can be detached, the fabric is opaque so the dress is not see-through. the fabric of the dress is sheer, soft and smooth, and i thought it was silk until i read the tag which listed as viscose. the details of this dress is breathtaking, from the flower design (check out the bottom horizontal lines of t",2
226,44,Fun and flattering!,"I got the dress with the boat pattern- such a fun dress and very flattering. it is definitely a coral, but i am able to wear this with my fair skin and will probably look better with some color as spring/summer finally arrive. i am only 5""2' so the length is great for me- i can wear this to work, but it would be pretty short for a tall gal. definitely recommend!",0

226,50,Gorgeous color and casual cool,The blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure,0
226,50,Great dress but heavy material,I just received this dress and tried it on. it's a nice dress that is flattering but the material was much heavier that i expected it to be. it's way to heavy to wear in the florida heat so unfortunately it's going back.,0
226,50,Great with leggings,"This dress is too short for me to wear as a dress, at 5'7"" and over 40. however is is great with leggings and boots.
it drapes nicely not over sized like many dresses this style. the color is more earthy than pictured. it's actually nicer in person than online. and it has a wonderful texture to it. i was drawn to it when i walked in the store they had it on display under s short cropped jacket and boots.",13

226,51,Fabric pattern can be askew,"This fabric is the same as the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's lightweight and stretchy. the problem with this particular dress is the pattern in the fabric will be a little different on each dress depending on how the pattern was cut when it was made. i had to try on 5 different dresses to find one that was cut so the pattern looked and fell in the right spots when wearing the dress. hence 4 stars. the bodice is lined but the skirt itself is not. it is not see through. i'm 5'4"" and 120#.",20

226,51,This is a cool dress with one issue...,"The linen makes it a big wrinkly mess. i tried it on and just the act of trying it on, made it so wrinkly. i would have bought it in a second had it not been for that. love the mango color..i am in-between a 2-4 and went with the 2. i'm 5'3 and the length was a few inches above my knee...there is also a separate slip attached.

226,53,Beautiful and classy,Wore this dress for easter dinner and received many compliments. it is delicate and if not careful the diamond pattern can snag. i loved the comfort and ability to dress up or down. i ordered the regular instead of petite as i wanted the length at my knees not thigh high. and it fit perfect at 5'4.,5

226,62,Fun for the upcoming holidays,"Love the crushed velvet and tried it on in the regular sizing in blue, but really needed the petite. although i tried on the xs in the regular sizing, i was afraid i'd need my normal sp, so i ordered that instead of the xsp. should have stuck with the xsp and will be exchanging it for that size. it definitely is dress length (but dowdy dress length in the regular for me at 5'1"") and the petite sizing is not all that much shorter, but enough to be cute. expecting a lot of use, especially over the",1
226,62,Pretty in pink,I love this dress! easy breezy flowy comfortable & pink! fits a true medium ...would recommend to anyone. makes me a little flirty!,0
226,62,This product fabric feels great.,"It slips on easily, is soft & flattering. it will definitely be my ""go to"" dress.",1
226,62,,I bought this dress as a surprise for my daughter. she was very happy with it.,0
226,62,,"This dress is perfect for spring and early summer. it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully. it is very well made and the fabric is good quality. the color is a medium color gray; much prettier than in the picture. i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small. it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture.. the length was just as it looked on the model. i am 5' 5"".",7
226,63,A gorgeous swing dress,"This is an amazing summer dress! so pretty it stood out even though only a few were left on the rack. it's light, airy and perfect even for the hottest summer days. the straps are not adjustable but for me the dress was not too low and it fit just like on the model pictured. a very thin belt comes with it but adds nothing ,only detracts. i am usually a s or m in retailer sizing and the s was perfect. 
 ( for ref. 5'7', 140 lbs) this dress is so flawless and beautiful and i feel wonderful wearing",22
226,63,Great first romper,"I've never owned a romper, and never had any desire to. but the classy design in black, soft, flowy fabric reeled me in, prompting me to push my boundaries a bit. i'm so glad i did. i don't think i have any other piece of clothing that makes me feel so classy or so fun, and certainly not at the same time. i wear it to work in an office environment with a cardigan, and the cardigan goes off after work as i run errands or play with the kids. i love it!! (and it even has pockets - i'm a sucker for",2
226,63,Speaking to the older (still hip) size 12-14 & up,"Love this dress! purchased it online, the xl sizes can be difficult to find in the store. dress is very cute on and you don't need to be reed thin like the model. it flatters the figure and yes, i wore spank with it. the length is good, the design (black and neutral) is flattering. i chose this to wear to my husband's christmas office party (his new job)! you know first impressions; i did not want to be over dressed. i wore my antho black boots which lace in back and go over the knee- (slouch a",2

226,64,Love this dress!,"I usually wear a 4, but ordered a 2 & 0 because of the previous reviews. the 2 fit perfectly. the 0 was too snug across the shoulders. both sizes were the same length and width except the shoulders.the material is beautiful and seems very well made. i am thrilled with this purchase.it looks exactly like the photo.",0
226,64,Lovely spring dress,Comfortable and true to size. it fits more fitted on the top and very swingy/flowy on the bottom. i got a petite and the length was perfect. if you like to wear very high heels you may want to go with a regular as its a tad short.,1
226,64,Sad sack,"Well...this is ""on me"" as i saw this hanging in the store, but way off on my size which is xxs petite.

i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.

both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no ""flow,"" just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.

this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes",9

226,65,Great and fun dress,,0
226,65,Very cute dress,"The dress is very cute, probably more on the casual side. i ordered the 2 petite and it hits me a few inches above the knee, which is what i wanted. the material of the dress and under slip is a little thin, but it looked nice after i ironed it. the top part of the dress looks great and shows off my shoulders nicely.",6
226,66,An original!,"I saw this dress on the cashier at retailer and had to order it. it is, as one of the reviewers said, like having two dresses in one. the bottom dress is a full dress, and the top lays over it, not quite skimming but not quite loose either. i love the dress as i am a pear shaped, size 14, and this helps to camouflage some bumps nicely. this dress reminds of the dresses some peasant women wear in rural countries.",0
226,66,Work and play,"This dress is great for work and play. i bought a l and a xl. both fit well, but the sleeves in the large were quite tight. so i kept the xl although it is a bit loose. this dress looks great on. i wish the material was a little higher quality, but i loved the design and plan to wear it with boots. the top is cotton and i liked the lace up feature at the neckline.",3
226,67,Gorgeous,"This is truly a lovely dress. the colors are beautiful and i love the contrasting but complimentary fabrics which add interest to an already elegant dress. the material is substantial without being stiff so that it flows gracefully and it flatters the figure.
in my opinion if fits true to size, i'm 32b, 5' and 103lbs and i got it in a 2p which is the size i normally get in dresses. it is slightly more loose than other retailer dresses in the same size but it still follows your curves without being",0
226,67,Prettier in person,"I got this dress in the mail today, and it's one of the best dresses i've ever gotten at retailer.. the material is of high quality and feels silky against the skin. the fit is true to size for maeve, and is so flattering. for reference, i'm thin (116 lbs), but curvy and usually order a regular xs. in maeve, i'm usually an xsp, and the xsp fit perfectly. it looks good with a wide cream colored crocheted belt (also from retailer), or on its own.",9

226,68,,"I love this dress because its very playful and bouncy. it puts me in a light hearted mood when i wear it. i originally wanted to buy the grey color but my store only had the navy, so i tried it on. the navy is brighter and more colorful than it looks on line and the stripes are more varied in color than in the picture - so its quite appealing and vibrant. the lines of the dress are also quite flattering. all in all, its a fun dress!",1
226,68,,"I tried this on in store in blue, and it's so comfortable. it's just the right level of loose to be flattering. for me, the cap sleeves were a little strange. they just didn't sit in a way that was flattering or seemed purposeful--not sure if that was the design or my body.",3

226,69,Great dress,"Great dress - the hardest part was picking which color. the dress is a slim swing silhouette and very flattering. the fabric skims the body without highlighting my problem areas (lower abdomen and hips). the dress is modest enough for work (it ends a few inches above the knee in the middle, comes to my knee on the sides). i am always a xs or s in maeve - i went with the small on this dress. the sleeves aren't as long as the picture shows - they ended where they should. i went with the navy and w",17

looks good with navy tights too!",0
226,72,,"This dress is perfect for my florida lifestyle because of the fabric and the design. it is not the color pictured on the web page which was a disappointment. the color is a lot duller. i tried it on in the store and found it to be tight across the chest, another lady who also tried it had the same problem. i went home and ordered a larger size. that dress was baggy and not as cute in the back. i realized because of the under slip it could be left open to the waist and work just fine. i ended up",1
226,74,Bloomsbury,,0
226,74,,"Based on the other reviews, i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p, but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering. i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn't work. i can't imagine this would flatter very many people. the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive. very disappointed--this will be going back for sure.",0
226,75,More cons than pros,"The material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves, i would buy in a minute. we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining. now the cons, i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look. it runs short and i can't imagine who thought this design was a good idea. there were no reviews when i ordered. i am learning to try it on in the store and/or read the reviews before investing. i would say go up a",1
226,77,Cute but difficult,I thought the design was adorable. i ordered up bc of reviews and i am glad i did. i am a size 6 so i ordered a size 8. the upsize is needed so u can get into the top part of the romper. otherwise it would be mission impossible. it's a pain to get on and off as all rompers are but it's soo cute it's worth it. had compliments on it the first day i wore it.,0
226,79,Love this dress!,"Soft and flowy. fit is great. quality is great. i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well. i haven't worn a dress in 10+ years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first. highly recommend.
i paired this with 4"" short black suede boots and black tights. many compliments (even from my husband and he doesn't usually pay much attention).",1
226,82,Great dress!!,"I am 5'4"" 140 pounds and ordered the 8 petite. it fits perfectly and is very flattering. the embroidery and lace up neckline thing is really awesome. it gives the dress some character... i am also a fan of the roll-up sleeves. i wish it came in other colors because i would certainly order more than one. the one and only potentially negative aspect, and i say potential because i'm not sure if its an issue or not as i haven't worn/washed it yet is it appears to be something that i may have to iron",5
226,99,Beachy and boho!,"I love the weight of the material; sometimes crinkled gauze looks cheap; this does not. the lace trim is more 2-tone than the photo suggests, but that is not negative, and the color of the dress is more salmon than peach, again, not a negative. the length is as it is on the model, just below the knee. i wore it to what turned out to be surprise party for me at the beach! i paired it with huge silver hoops and silver flipflops. i felt special, stylish and comfortable. it was a good dress for some",1
227,22,Sweater season,"Ive been on the hunt for big bulky sweaters because winter is coming and i live in the north, i saw this sweater and needed to give it a try. i got it i the mail and its truly gorgeous and extremely well made. this is the type of sweater to wear on a cold snowy day. it runs a little big but thats okay with me because its perfect to snuggle up in. i love this sweater but be aware it is thick and bulky so its not made to make you look like a twig. i like big sweaters and this design flows from sma",2
227,33,"Pretty, ordered in wrong size","I ordered this online in the cream color and because some of the reviews mentioned the shorter back, i went with a medium, but that ended up running too big. i typically wear between a 4 and a 6 / small and medium so i'm always on the fence about which size to get. i often order both online and return the one that doesn't fit as well, so i wish i had this time too! the detail on the front is super cute and i didn't even mind the plainer back, but the sleeves went well past my wrist and i felt li",1
227,36,Girl scout smock,"I liked the concept of this vest, but when i tried it on, i felt like i was 9 years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform. it was also very boxy and wide. it seemed to be well-made, though, and maybe would have worked if it were a different color.",1
227,37,Great casual cardigan,"Beautiful cardigan, but it does run large.  i'm about 5'9"", 160 lbs, normally a large in tops, and the medium fits great. it's still a bit roomy, but i think this cardigan is meant to be a tad roomy.  i agree with another reviewer that it's a bit itchy on bare skin, but it's wool, so that's a given.  overall, a great cardigan for fall!",0
227,41,The perfect fall sweater,"Nice quality, can work as a jacket or sweater. i've worn with and without the tie. i didn't realize from the pictures but the sleeves bell out giving it an extra touch.",1
227,42,"Lovely, flattering, thick sweater","I love this sweater. i found it in the sale section a few weeks ago but wasn't sure if it would be too bulky. it had a dark smudge on the collar left from someone or something. i thought maybe it had been left behind by others for that reason because the quality was so nice. thankfully, i washed it and the smudge came out. 


i live in houston, tx and don't need to wear wool or cashmere sweaters for warmth. this is mostly cotton. it is well made. the sleeves were longer on me than the model,",0
227,44,Great topper piece,This sweater/jacket is great over any blouses. love the color. it looks more slightly peachy cream color that i love! goes with everything. warm. i thought it ran true to size. i ordered a small and love the way it fits. if you are looking for more of an oversized piece then you would need to size up.,0
227,45,Love the lace detail,"This is a really pretty sweater. it is also very soft (no wool or fur)! yay! it is covers my bum, which i love. the ivory is slightly sheer so you may want to wear a cami with it. i have it on my wish list.",0
227,46,Sweater review,"I bought this sweater to wear with leggings for fall and winter.  the quality is nice, but the color is a bit different than the pic.  it has more brown than true berry in it.  it is very soft and stretchy, but is a bit boxy on.  i am debating whether to keep it or not.  it was a little cheaper with my birthday discount applied, but not sure i'd keep it if it was full price.",2
227,49,"Great sweater, not crazy about the collar","I didn't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i'm not really liking it. it's the rough, unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well, rough around the edges. it's a nicely cut, great fitting sweater though so i'll be looking for some scarves!",0
227,49,Versatile piece,I purchased this in gray and it is proving to be quite versatile. it is softer than i expected and not heavy or bulky. i also like that the side slits are a bit higher than i expected. i have paired it with knit pants and with a maxi dress. i think it will work pretty much any time i need an extra layer.,1
227,51,Nice sweater,"I purchased the cedar one. not sure where they got color name from since i don't see any cedar in it. the picture of the model is accurate in coloring and fit. tts, the sleeves are a little wider and longer at bottom but in a good way (to me). the pockets and belt are a suede-like material which makes for a lovely detail. it's not a slender-izing piece but not a frumpy fit imo at all. soft material and nicely made, but for that price i would hope so.",0
227,53,Long sleeves,"I ordered this sweater in green in petite large. the color and knit is beautiful and the shoulders and body fit comfortably; however, the sleeves were very long for a petite. i roll them, and it looks okay but would have rather had a normal petite length sleeve.",0
227,53,Perfect weight,"While there are a countless number of ""winter-white wear-with everything"" sweaters, this is the best one i have seen yet. it is a substantial weight without being coat-like. it is cozy and can be crossed over in front to wrap if desired and it is not itchy as it is cotton. and it's hand washable! i would say it' runs true to size. i wear a 0-2 and petite ( 5 ft 2 in). i purchased the xs but not in petite becasue i wanted the length. it fits fine in the shoulders but the sleeves hit me at my knuc",8

best gift to date.",0
227,56,Love it!,"This is a great sweater. great color and style. i love that it's a little retro. can be worn with jeans and tights. highly recommend. it does run a little big, but not by a lot.",0
227,57,"Unique,colorful but has some flaws","Love the colors in this autumn designed sweater that i just received but it has to be returned. i disagree with one of the reviews that it is not as pictured as far as the green being ""off."" i think it is just as pictured. i love the texture of the large pockets and belt with the suede feel. i love the flap on the back. what i don't like is how large it is. i have never worn an xs from retailer and i should have listened to the advice from the previous reviews but i didn't. 
i could send it back",1
227,63,Had to send it back,"I was so excited to order this sweater. i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days. ordering it on sale made it all the better. however, when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were, with little definition. the sweater itself lacks definition as well, just shapeless and hangy. i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on.",2
227,64,Soft as a kitten!,"This is a well made sweater. i sometimes have a problem with wool but this is as soft as cashmere and does not itch at all. the color is beautiful and will work with gray,black,tan and navy. i found this to run a little bit on the large side. i am between a size large and extra large and ordered the extra large. there is too much fabric on the sides and the peplum starts at an awkward spot, mid hip instead of waistline. i think that sizing down to a large will solve these problems. it is really",0
228,26,Not very functional,"This vest doesn't have a button, so i thought i could put my own. but when it arrived, it just didn't fit that well. the opening in the front is too big, the vest itself while nice and warm is not functional at all due to openings everywhere. i don't know, why even make a vest like this with no front button and such a wide opening, how is one supposed to keep warm at all?",0
228,31,Love this coat!,"I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price, and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat. the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily. other than that, the silhouette of the coat is perfect...not too boxy! it's also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter. i love it!",2
228,33,Great purchase,Great purchase! i bought the coat to wear to work.,1
228,35,Nice jacket but too large!,This jacket is made well and looks great but sadly i ordered the size 00p and it was still too large! if it had of been smaller i'd love it but it wasn't so i had to return it....,1
228,41,So cozy and lovely!,"I absolutely love this jacket! it's one of the best things i've bought this season. the interior is so unbelievably soft. i just want to wrap myself in it with nothing but a tank top on underneath so i can really feel the texture against my skin. the fit is beautiful, as is the pattern. it's even better in person than in the photo. it is pricey, but for the longevity and pleasure that i can imagine myself getting out of it, it's well worth it.",6
228,59,Beautiful coat- shedding could be a deal breaker,"I really love this coat! i usually wear a size 8 but ordered up a size because i just wanted that look. it is a very warm coat, wasn't expecting that! it is very soft and i love it! one problem, it sheds like crazy, bummer. i wore it over a black turtle neck sweater and when i took my coat off it looked like i had a white cat living in my house. my sweater was covered. i'm hoping it will shed less as i wear it longer. having said that,, i still love the look and warmth. i will just need to plan",1
228,75,"Classic, upscale coat",,1
229,26,Buy these now.,"These cords are seriously fantastic. worth the price indeed. they are very comfy, have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape! the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop. they do run big, i got a 26 and i'm usually a 27. they are also very long! nothing a little trip to tailors can't fix. overall, highly recommended.",0
229,34,"Cute leggings for cooler days, but be aware of fit","I've been wanting to add some cords to my wardrobe and had to give these a try. i ordered the blue color on-line in size 31. i'm somewhat in-between size 30 and 31 in jeans right now, so i thought i'd be on the safe side and go up. i ended up keeping these and i'm happy with my purchase, although i do feel like the cut of the leggings is a bit off for me. i am a proportional hour-glass shape and i found these leggings to be quite snug in the thigh, while being oversized in the waist.
in the end,",2
229,35,Sizing is all over the map!,"If you happen to get a size that fits you, you will love these leggings. they are true to size when the quality control works. i got 2 pair, both in size 28 - one fits perfectly and the other fits like my mothers high waisted jeans! the material is very soft and comfortable. also, not sure who named these colors, but the grey is really light purple and the dark grey is dark purple.",0
229,36,,"I really wanted the dark grey, but it has been sold out in my size for many months. i finally ended up with the navy. i think they are much cuter in person, the color nicer also. i think the cuffs have been folded under in some of the pictures of the models making the shape look just a tad odd. i got my usual size, and the fit was perfect. they stretch just enough. i would get the second pair in a heartbeat.",0

229,60,Couture cords,So sure from the online shop & images that i ordered two pairs. the package arrived in less than 2 days and immediately i could see how the cords were everything i expected them to be. so incredibly soft and body forming and has a classic cord texture only softer. i love them ! this look works both daytime as well as evening - it's geared to work with any casual to couture look. my 22 year old niece wanted to buy the second pair (sz 28) from me so i gave them to her. she's a nice niece : ),0
229,66,Super cute pants,I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants. these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter. they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans. the pants are so comfortable and flattering. love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up. i am in my 60's and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age. retailer is my favorite store!,1
230,29,Beautiful summery dress,"This dress is really lovely. if fits and flows in a very flattering way although it is a bit long (i'm really tall so that's a very nice feature for me :p) it actually feels more linen-y than i expected to which was surprising, (i probably didn't read the product description close enough) but it was a pleasant surprise. can't wait to wear this to brunch/beach parties this summer! fair warning, it's also a little see-through - might want to wear nude underwear ;)",4
230,29,Very cute dress...for a different body type,"This is a lovely, well-made piece by maeve, a longtime favorite of mine. the material is great weight and won't wrinkle, colors are vibrant, and design of the dress is cute, if a bit on the short side.

however, i, like some of the other reviewers, didn't love this this on me. the waist hit slightly above my natural waist (and i'm very short-waisted) and this particular sweetheart neckline did nothing to flatter my bust (i'm a 34dd for reference). the end result was a bit too dowdy on top with",0

230,32,Lovely,"The dress is lovely. my only knock on it is i didn't really feel like the top and the skirt matched in terms of level of dress. i guess the top just wasn't ""fancy"" enough for me. but it is a very beautiful skirt. i wish it was in a tea length. the fit was spot on.",4

230,49,Runs very small on top.,"This dress is quite lovely in person, but it runs very small, particularly in the bust. i'm usually okay with a large in retailer dresses (sometimes medium), but i had a hard time getting into this, and the top was literally about 10"" from being able to zip up. granted, i have a larger than average bust, but that's still excessive, and the fabric has no give whatsoever.
the online pictures are pretty accurate representations in terms of look and shape. i think it would probably be best for pear s",1
230,52,Craftsmanship,"I so wanted to love this dress. i bought it in a size 4 and in both petite and regular, as i'm kind of in between and have a long torso and short legs. anyway, i'm 5'5"" tall and 130 lbs. the regular fit my torso well, and length not was too bad. with heals it might have worked without hemming. here is where it all fell apart. while understand that only really expensive designer clothing can afford to seam a pattern perfectly, i felt that the dot seam in the front of the dress was in a bad place.",23
230,62,Looks like lemonade and ice cream!,"Such a pretty dress and the colors are just so summery. it's very flattering on but i will have to return it unfortunately. i ordered the 6p because the 8p was sold out and although the top fits quite well, its just too snug on the hips. if the 8p was available i would definitely exchange it for that.",3
230,62,Rehearsal dinner dress,"I bought this dress for a dinner after my daughter's wedding rehearsal. it is perfect. it is dressy enough for the occasion. it also has a casual look to it. i think it is very versatile. i fell in love with the colors, material and the quality. i am more excited about this dress then the dress i am wearing to the wedding. buy it you'll love it.",0
230,64,So comfortable!!,"I ordered this online, having never seen it in person. i loved it as soon as i touched the soft material. it fits me perfectly...i almost invariably wear a size 6 in retailer dresses and tops, which gave me the confidence to order online, and this dress is true to size. the detailing at the bosom is so flattering. the fabric is supple and hangs gracefully without clinging to my not-so-perfect waistline. i have worn this twice already, having received it only a week ago. the blue/black combi",7
230,91,I don't understand this dress,"I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so, but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no, retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice, the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress",3
231,21,Beautiful dress!,"I **love** this dress. it's definitely an investment, but well worth the price! i get so many compliments on it every time i wear it, and it can definitely be dressed up or down for casual or formal events.",0
231,21,Bold and beautiful,"Not only is this dress incredibly comfortable, but it can be accessorized for any occasion. i jazzed it up for a wedding, but a cardigan and flats also makes it easy saturday perfect. only way this dress could be improved.... pockets.",0
231,22,Cute but just not right,I love the style of this dress but felt that it didn't look great on. really sad it didn't work out :( felt like it was too short and the drop waist was awkward and looked childish. beautiful fabric and design if it fits you well though!,1
231,23,Love the dress just not on,"I loved this dress online, however i did not love it on me. it was a bit snug in the waist and bust (i usually order a 2 or 4 but got the dress in a 4). i thought i would love the mid length but it felt awkward on me (i'm 5'10""). i think its a beautiful dress just didn't work for me.",1
231,25,Cute in theory,"Adorable, old school retailer; the only gripe i have is trying to get this on. the slip is similar to putting on a straight jacket. once you figure it out, then it's gorgeous. just be careful and lay it out carefully before you pull it over your head.",6

231,26,Beautiful detail; loose fit,"Loved the fabric and details. the cut was a tad looser/bigger than i expected.
perfect dress for fall.",0
231,27,Darling dress!,"I bought this dress for my mom! she usually does not even try dresses on because she feels that they highlight her ""problem areas"", but she is going on a vacation soon and i thought she could should bring something different for her trip. thankfully, the embroidered waters shirtdress completely surprised her! the fabric is soft and light, the blue is vibrant and perfect for spring/summer, and the cutwork detailing is flirty without being too risky or revealing. she's really excited about this--a",6
231,27,So disappointed!,I was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person. it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles. pass!,2
231,29,Stunning dress,This dress is beautiful and extremely well made. there is s little more weight to the fabric than i had assumed but it's nice for fall/transition/cooler temps. i'm so sad that i will most likely return this dress because it's just not working on my postpartum body but there is a part of me that wants to keep it because of how stunning it is.,1
231,29,Was very excited....but not for large busted,"This sweater is gorgeous...it is of great quality and very warm. i was very excited and wanted it to look great. however....i have a large bust and am full figured...so it was not appealing and just kind of ""hung there"". i feel that it would look great on thinner women...and it is a gorgeous sweater...just not for me!",0
231,29,Weird fit,"This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size, it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out. 

the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust.",3
231,31,Cute and comfy,"Very cute and comfy dress. i'm 5'6"" and 117 pounds and the xs worked great. it is meant to fit big and comfy so don't expect a tailored dress. looks great with tights and boots and i love that you can turn it around to make it a cardigan!",5
231,31,Disappointing,"I wanted to love this because it's all my favorites: simple, chic design; pure silk; gorgeous color. in reality, the dress was 100% see-through, very thin, and poor quality silk. i posted pictures of me wearing this dress with a nude slip on underneath that i brought along for shopping elsewhere for business dresses. despite the thin quality of the silk, i was still considering spending this dress (despite it's unreasonably high $$$ for the quality), but after trying it on i was really disappoin",4
231,31,Fabulous fall dress,"This dress is beautiful - the pattern is pretty and the beading detail is stunning. i immediately received many compliments the first day i wore it. i do think it is a little short so i bought a size up (i also like loose fitting clothing) and i wore it with bare legs and boots and felt ok, will likely add leggings or tights as the weather gets cooler.",1
231,31,,"Really cute dress and i cannot wait to wear it for my wedding rehearsal dinner. the buttons on the back are my favorite part about the dress since they add something different. it fits tts, but it is more fitted than a regular shift dress, which is nice. i am 5'9, 145 pounds, and the size 6 fit me perfectly.",3

231,32,Perfect fall number,"This dress is amazing beautiful and perfect for fall. the colors and beading are so much better in person. the pockets are an added bonus! i'm typically a xs but sized up to a s only because i felt the sleeves were tight and across the bust was tighter than i'd like when moving my arms. the xs would have worked but the s is perfect comfort. i highly recommend this beauty. for reference, i'm 5'2, 120 lbs.",3
231,32,,"Really cute dress for work. fits exactly as i expected. this dress is very comfortable and looks put together on days when you're being lazy and just want to ""throw something on"".",5
231,32,,So disappointed! beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange. loose and baggy through the top and mid-section but tight around the buttock and thighs.,0
231,33,Beautiful but slight problem,I'm normally between a 4-6 in retailer dresses. i had to go up to a size 10 just to get the buttons across the chest to close and lay properly without feeling like i would bust out. definitely not for those with any kind of chest.,6
231,33,Compliments galore!,Love this so much. it's beautiful and i get tons of compliments. it's a touch short as a dress but looks amazing with leggings!,1
231,33,Extremely well made,"The detail and overall quality of the fabric is incredible. i normally avoid swing dresses, but this is a flattering dress. i typically wear between sizes 2-6 (depending on designer) and a 6 fit me perfectly. i'm extremely happy that i purchased it and received compliments as soon as i wore it out. i'm also tall, so i have to be concerned with length of dresses and this falls perfectly right at the top of the knee.",0
231,33,Lovely sweater/tunic,"I tried this on in the store, and i found my regular medium to be a bit too boxy. i ended up going with the petite large because i found it just fit better. it wasn't too wide and fit just right.
it is very soft, not itchy at all. it says dry clean only but it did great on my hand wash setting with cold water. laid it out to dry. great purchase.",6
231,33,"Runs small, but still a good dress","This dress is beautiful in person, the details on it are amazing. the only problem i had was that it ran small. i am usually an 8 or 10 in retailer dresses, but had to size up to a 12 just to be able to breath. the top on the 10 was tight in the chest and arms. when i sized up to the 12 there was more room, but not by much. the embroidery detail on the dress is the best part, it is exactly as shown in the picture. plus it has pockets which is always a plus for me. lightweight and great for warm we",0
231,33,Soft and sweet,"This is a very cute dress, with a comfortable fit. my only gripe is that i could not get the top of the v-neck slip to stop shifting to the side.",9
231,33,The details...,"This is a great dress that i was eyeing for some time. i bought it after new year's with the 40% off discount. unfortunately the dress arrived with a defect so i have to have it fixed.

the quality of the dress is amazing. the details are truly unique. one could tell that the dress is very well made. however, it does run large. i bought the xs and feel that i could have downsized at least one to two sizes! it's very comfortable and it could be dressed up or down.

overall, im happy with the purc",0
231,34,Beware if you're fuller in the chest,"I loved the lace detailing all over this dress and the fact it had pockets and was mostly cotton. it just looked so inviting, so i grabbed two sizes to try on (10 & 12) that 99% of the time fit me with retailer clothes. here are my thoughts:
__________
pros:
- lace detailing is lovely all over.
- everything runs tts except at the bust (see below).
- breathable fabric, comfortable.
_________
cons:
- i'm a 36c and could not button the top two buttons of this dress in a size 10 (i'm 5'9, hourglass, a",122
231,34,Gorgeous dress but ill fitting,"I bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer. it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large. i loved the feel, color (grey) and style of the dress, but i ended up returning it because of the fit. it also requires something under it since it is fairly see-through.",0
231,34,Size up!,"I am normally a size 4/6p in all things retailer but read the reviews and opted to go petite on the maxi and size up. i went with the 8p and even with a 32d bust, had no trouble zipping and it fit beautifully. the band is a tad loose, but any tighter wouldn't have fit in the bust. this dress hangs beautifully and is incredibly flattering, especially for those of us with an athletic build.",1
231,34,Tight in chest area,My bra size is a 36 c. i got the medium and the dress buttoned looked nothing like the model... the top button barely buttoned....,1
231,35,I don't want to take it off ever!,I just bought this dress today and i'm in love! i can't wait for the wedding i am wearing it to so i can wear it to other fun things too! looks even more amazing in heels.,2
231,35,It's gorgeous,Should've ordered a larger size. it runs a bit tight around the top and the zipper isn't that helpful.,0
231,35,Love this dress,"Fit and flare, pullover style that can easily be dressed up or down. wish other colors were available online!",1
231,35,Lovely dress,"This dress will be very useful. it fits loose, but it is suppose to. i plan to wear this to casual parties, out to dinner, and possibly a wedding at a winery. i weigh am 5' 6"", weigh 145 lbs, and ordered a medium.",5
231,35,Poor fabrication,,1
231,35,This was used!!!,,0
231,35,,"I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5'5"", 120 lbs, straight figure, very tiny ""girls"") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the ""swin",1
231,36,Casual cool,"I am tall, so this dress hits slightly above the knee on me. the peek-a-boo detail on the skirt and shoulders is flirty, but still modest. this dress is super comfortable and is going to be a summer staple for me. i also love that this dress is button-down, it is an easy piece to wear for new moms!",0
231,36,,"I fell in love with this dress the second i saw it in store. i haven't experienced any of the issues others have. i love the short, flowy, feminine look and i think it can be dressed up or down. it would be great for a summer wedding or cocktail event, or dressed down as a day dress with a jean jacket. i've received compliments every time i've worn it.",0
231,36,,"This dress is beautiful. it is tts, but since it is so flowy, is not form fitting. i am petite (5'4"" 115lbs) and this is a lot of dress for a shorter/smaller person. if it were less flowy, i would keep it. the design, material and overall product is, however, amazing! this dress would be a beautiful addition to any closet.",3
231,37,Definitely ivory,"I saw this dress and was immediately drawn to it. the pictures others posted of themselves wearing it just made me want it more. i knew the color said ivory when i ordered it, but i wasn't prepared for how yellow it was. there is a liner/slip and it was honestly a pale yellow. it made the whole thing look dingy. i was so disappointed. if this dress was white i would've kept it. sadly i had to return. i am 5'1, around 135 lbs and i ordered a petite 6. i probably could've gone a petite 4. very cut",1
231,37,Fall staple,Super cute dress for fall. detail is much more intricate than what you are able to see online. not too long and will look perfect with tights and boots.,1
231,37,Just perfect,I very rarely buy at full price but had to have this on and it is worth it.  i sized down and fits great. tons of compliments!,0
231,37,,I love this dress! i wore it to my friends bridal shower and got so many compliments! i can't wait to wear it again!,0
231,38,Beautiful dress but very large,"This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however, the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful, there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference, i am 24 waist",1
231,38,Comfortable with great details,"This is a great, easy-to-wear dress with lovely beaded detailing all over the front bodice and ladder lace trim running the length of the sleeves. easily dressed up or down. i usually wear petites but ordered the regular size based on previous reviews, and the slightly longer length was perfect for me (it hit just above the knees). there were a few beads that were coming a little loose, so i did have to secure those but it wasn't a big deal for me as i'm pretty comfortable with light mending, et",1
231,38,Preggers,"I really wanted to love this dress. i love the colors and the design of the dress. unfortunately, i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant. it's so voluminous that it's not flattering at all. also agree that the lining is scratchy.",1

231,39,"Beautiful, looks fragile but well-made","Love this dress, the colors are stunning, the make is beautiful...i don't know where to start. the body part is a nice neutral color, and has beautiful beading, my concerns is snagging since the fabric is so flowy and the beading pokes out sort of... i love that they used different patterns on the layers, the skirt bottom layer has cute polka dots that are translated on the sleeves (bottom of the sleeves). sleeves, are, by the way, fun and bubble-like. the cut of the dress is not following the b",4
231,39,Laura ingalls eat your heart out,"Retailer is totally killing my wallet because i can't resist these modern-city-meets-prairie-boho dresses. i bow down to the textile designers who created this print, it's stunning. as for reality vs. model shoot, it's pretty much what you see--the colors are spot on, the outer dress is sheer, the bodice is slightly fitted, with a fuller skirt that doesn't poof too much. all poly construction with no stretch whatsoever. i had a bit of a struggle getting the outer dress over my shoulders but once a",10

231,39,Runs big in bust,"The first reviewer said it was small in the bust, but the 0p i ordered fit everywhere, rib cage and all, but was gaping at the bust (in the back). i would say overall it was true to size but if i sized down, it would be too snug in the rib cage. i am 30dd for reference there and waist is 26.5 inches,

231,41,Too peasanty,"I read the online reviews and thought this dress would be a winner. it is tight in the chest (i am not busty) and i would have exchanged it for a larger size but i just didn't like the style. the material is beautiful but between the neutral colors and the style, i felt it was too ""little house on the prairie"". pretty but not the look i was going for.",0

231,42,Pretty dress,"It's a pretty dress, my only concern is the sleeve length. it's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy. i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better!. or, if you are a savvy sewer, you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted. overall quality and feel is very good. i usually fit into a 6, but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you don't order the correct size.",0
231,42,Such a fun dress!,I love this dress! it is super cute and swingy. a perfect summer dress - dress it up or even for a fun summer afternoon with sandals. the fit is great (the armholes on the regular 0 were a little big. the 0petite is much better),1

231,44,Rules apply,"This dress is breathtaking in person: the back tie, the lace on the sides, the hem, the sleeves, the pleats at the chest, and the liner is opaque so it's not see-through. but it's very white, baby doll cut, and very short. in order to avoid the maternity, wedding-ish look, a few rules must be applied (thanks to retailer stylist ): buttons all the way up, a belt is a must to break the monotony of the all-over white and lace look. i purchased size 2 regular, and it still falls about 3 inches above m",2

231,47,,I tried this dress on in hawaii before it even hit the website. i am guessing retailer tests out their spring line in always summer hawaii. i was impressed but wanted to wait for a promo. there is a lining that fluffs up the skirt part of dress and makes it fun and girly. i sized up to 4p from my usual 2p in holding horses due to the tailored upper part of the dress and my shoulders a wee bit wide.,19
231,48,"Great quality, amazing dress",Swing dresses can be so iffy but this one is fantastic! i sized down to an xs due to the chest area (i'm usually a s/6 up top 36b) and it fits perfectly. the dress is so comfortable and stylish without feeling like you're wearing a tent. this is the most i've ever spent on a casual dress and it is worth ever penny. could not be more happy with my purchase.,0
231,48,,I absolutely love this dress. i am 5'0 and 167 pounds and the extra large was way too big. the large was perfect. the fabric is substantial but the fit is loose and swingy so it is good for the atlanta heat and humidity. i want to wear this every day.,0
231,48,,I ordered my normal size 6 in this dress and could barely get it on. it runs very small. i would suggest going up a size or maybe even two sizes up.,4

231,49,Disappointing,,2
231,49,Not for anyone with a large chest!!,"I'm a 36ddd and although that's pretty large, i don't generally have trouble fitting into most retailer clothing. (the tracy reese amoret dress, for example, fits just fine in my regular size.) so, i ordered this dress in my regular size. well, i tried it on, and the right and left sides of the front closure on top were literally about 10 inches apart. there was *no way* this would fit, even if i went up 3 sizes. it's crazy!
this is a terrible shame because it's really a lovely dress and it fits j",3
231,49,Not quite what i expected,,2
231,50,A big disappointment,This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes,7
231,50,Just right,"I ordered this in a size s, my usual size and it fits great. i love the color, style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of, ever so slightly, poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color, i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!",0
231,50,Love this dress,"One of the things i love most about this dress is that the straps are adjustable. you can tie them as loose or tight as you like. like other reviewers mentioned, the color of this dress is vibrant and the fringe at the bottom is the perfect detail retailer is famous for doing! i am 5'5 105 lbs and lately all of the dresses i have been buying at retailer have been xsp. i have never worn petites before, so i don't know if retailer is just making their dresses a little bigger, but i definitely have neede",1
231,50,Wanted to like it,"I thought this dress was very cute on the model, however it was way too tight across the chest for me. going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else. also, fabric wasn't great.",0
231,51,Wasn't a good fit,"I really thought from the picture that the dress would be more fit for a curvy figure. it is, unfortunately, more well suited to those women with straighter lines. the color was more flat than the picture as well, but i bet it is lovely in navy.",1
231,52,Should have believed the negative reviews,"Like most people here, i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so, i decided to see for myself if maybe, just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all, the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso, like a 32 or 33, possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly, but with a 36 c, i could not get a size 12 to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot, and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad",2
231,53,Beautiful dress,This dress is so beautiful in person. i actually am currently wearing it with jeans and i get so many compliments on it. this picture on the website does not really do it justice. very flowy beautiful top/dress.,3
231,53,Love the dress,"I just bought this dress as it went on sale recently. i read all the other reviews - and, imho, the dress is ivory not yellow as another reviewer suggested. i am only 5'2"" and weigh 115llbs - there were no petite sizes available so i bought a size 2 which is a bit long, but that's ok. the arm holes weren't too small and the neckline is large enough to slip over my head. the dress is very much a swing dress...i wish there was just a little less dress...it really is too voluminous for my taste. i",0
231,56,Pretty dress,,0
231,59,,Love this dress!! will go from fall to winter. so comfy. got it in medium.. and fits great.,2
231,60,Great summer dress!!,"Like other reviewers have stated, this dress does run small on the chest. i'm 5.3"", 32c, 120lbs and size 2 fits me great. however, if my chest size had been, like 34d and up, size 2 will not fit me although i'm petite frame. so, if you have a large chest, i would recommend going 1 or 2 sizes up. if you are like myself, small bust person, then you should try your regular size and one size down to see which one fits you better. i was going to try size zero, however as soon as i tried size 2, i rea",0
231,60,So much detail!,"There is so much going on on this dress - it's fantastic. hard to tell from pics - but there is a peek-a-boo lattice detail going down the front and back of the sleeves. the beading is plentiful but not too much for work. dress is significantly longer on me than the model - i'm 5'6"", but still a tad above the knee. with tall boots or booties and tights, this will go straight from work to out for the evening. i'm real long waisted - originally ordered m, but exchanged for l. much better fit overa",2
231,61,Love,This sweater dress is so soft and great quality...you can dress it up or down... i will get a lot of use out of it!,0
231,63,Perfect slim fit,"I'm 32b-26-36, straight and slim, and the 0 fits like a glove. it's a nice change from all these loose, billowy (sometimes sack or tent like) dresses. if you are busty or have a broad rib cage, you'll need to size up for sure. the slip is fitted and im wondering if it will stay put. love all the colors in this dress - navy was better for me, the white washed me out and was just underwhelming. the band of lace hits high on my waist at a spot that is flattering and slimming which doesn't happen of",3
231,64,Simple closet staple,"This dress is so simple, but gorgeous on. the top runs a bit small in the shoulders/bust. the top button gapes a bit in the bust area. the cuffs and collar insides are a different coordinating print and provides a cute option to roll or unbutton and press open to style.",0
231,65,Great dress!,This is a fantastic dress! i wore it for a recent wedding and received many compliments. the fit is phenomenal; the dress is extremely comfortable and flattering. i am full-figured and it fit beautifully and was very true to size. this dress would look good on an 18 year old or a 70 year old!,0
231,67,Lovely color but...,This sweater dress color is great and texture is nice however ran huge. read the other reviews before ordering and ordered down to a medium and was just to boxy and could not get it to hang well. unfortunately it went back.,0
231,78,Amazingly amazing,"This dress is gorgeous. it looks exactly as it appears on model. the model must be wearing a petite because the regular size dress is maxi length on anyone 5'8. the petite is midi length and is perfect every where else. i am not petite, but this petite worked perfect on me for midi length.
pros of dress
the dress has nice light float fabric, with colorblind on bottom for a touch of modern.
the dress looks very dowton abby and the vintage look is hard to find now days in dress.
the dress looks fa",16
231,83,Gorgeous and exotic dress,"This dress is stunning. it is beautifully made with laces and beading in a way that is art. it fits in a very flattering and comfortable way. i think is would flatter any body type. the details are captivating and it immediately grabs the spotlight when you walk into a room.
i ordered online and when it arrived i was stunned with it's exotic use of fabrics, textures.....a rare find and a must have.",0
232,25,Fun forties-esque dress,"I bought this dress in-store, and it's fantastic. i'm between a medium and a large, and i bought a large because it was the one available, and it's fantastic. some of the polyester is fraying between the seams, which is obviously not ideal, but i'm willing to overlook that for generally how great this dress is.",0
232,26,Cheshire dress,The cheshire dress is lovely. the fit is true to size and the quality is awesome. i love the way the sleeves lay on my shoulders. i would definitely recommend this dress!,1
232,28,Gorgeous dress,"This dress is very pretty in person, and perfect for warm and hot weather. the material is comfy and breathable, and the length is perfect. for reference, i usually wear a medium in retailer dresses, and ordered this in a medium as well. at that size, it does not bunch up around the waist as much as it would if i had ordered a large, but then the fit would have been baggier elsewhere on my body. i am fine with it being a closer fit across my waist, so i would say it fits true to size for me, but w",0
232,29,Beautiful easy to wear dress,"Weighs nothing. so comfortable. great length, not too short. fits a tad loose, but very pretty and easy to wear. fun print, flattering, casual style with a touch of class. 5'3 110lbs and the xs fits just as it shows on the model.",0
232,31,Beautiful but a little too 80s,"I wanted so badly to keep this dress :( the print is beautiful in person, and the fabric feels pretty nice for a polyester. the waist silhouette is incredibly flattering--the way the waistline and pleats fall made me a look a lot slimmer. it'd be a great dress for dancing, since it flares wonderfully when you twirl. but the puffed sleeves looked a lot more poofy on me than they did on the model, and i wound up looking exactly like a picture of my mother from 1982. which isn't necessarily a bad t",2
232,32,Great holiday dress!,"I highly recommend this dress!!!!!! i was a little nervous about purchasing this dress online because previous reviewers were saying that it creates static, but nothing that a little static guard couldn't prevent! :) i purchased a medium petite and i am about 5 feet tall, usually a size 8 in dresses and it fit perfect! (wore for thanksgiving) the fabric and style are very forgiving and the dress sort of flows with you when you walk, which i love!!",1
232,33,Odd cut/sizing,"As another reviewer noted, the upper portion (back, chest, shoulders, etc.) fit nicely. however, the body of the dress was enormous and did, indeed, make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.",3
232,33,Stunning color,"This is a gorgeous dress. the color is absolutely stunning and looks true to the photos online. the dress is a little too short and tight for a work dress, but too thick for a summer dress. it would be perfect for a date night, but since i have enough date dresses, and not that many dates...i opted not to purchase. it is gorgeous but i would suggest sizing up because i could barely zip in my standard size and the seams would definitely give after sitting.",0
232,33,Unflattering,I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.,10
232,33,,Beautiful dress. lots of compliments. will transition well from summer to fall.,3
232,34,Don't lift your arms,Dress looks awesome when your arms are down like the model. but don't you dare lift your arms. i'm kinda tall and the dress barely covers my bum when arms are raised. keeping the dress but will have to keep my arms down ;) maybe?,3
232,37,Love but runs small in the shoulders and bust,"This is a heartbreaker! love this dress's colors, length, flow, beading, and style but its extremely tight in the shoulders and bust. hate to see it go back....",0
232,38,Pass if you're busty,"The print and style we're great! unfortunately, my bust unbuttons the top. there's no way i can wear this, even if i sized up.",3
232,39,Beautiful dress but..,The dress is beautiful but runs small so unfortunately i have to return it.,10
232,39,Interesting,,4
232,39,"Pretty, thinner fabric than expected","Also, a little on the bigger size, i ended up not keeping the xs petite, as i felt it was a little loose and long (would have been more flattering on me a tad narrower and a bit more above my knee. colors are really pretty and so is the pattern. very comfortable and light.

232,40,Can i select runs too large and runs too small?,Loved the pattern and colors of this dress. the material was extremely heavy. the shoulders and across the back was very small so that i couldn't lift my arms or put them out straight in front of me. but then the rest of the dress was huge and shapeless. sadly i had to return it.,1
232,41,Beautiful and fun dress!,"This dress caught my eye because of the beautiful fabric, but i read the reviews online so i didn't buy it. i just went to a store and couldn't help but try on the size small. i usually range from an xs to a s, and i would say that the size s fits great around my shoulders. it is true what the other shoppers say about this dress being like a tent. it is and i won't lie about that. when i tried it on, i asked a sales person to bring me some belts to try on to create a waistline. once i put on a b",0
232,42,"Beautiful dress, awkward fit","This is a fantastic dress for fall, if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l, rather than in particular dress sizes, so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give), but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo), with a tightness at the clavicle, and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.

i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season,",0
232,42,Do not wash!,"I loved everything about this dress. the fit, the style and the ability to wear in the fall. i wore it once, washed it in gentle/hand-wash cycle, in cold water and laid it out flat to dry- per the instructions- and it shrank at least a full size. it's going back. i am so sad, as i said earlier, i really loved this dress.",5
232,43,Completely see-through!,"This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it's not flattering at all, and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.",18
232,44,Great for curvy girls,Beautiful dress for those with a large chest and small waist. sadly i am not one and needed to return the dress. fabric is heavy and the pattern is great.,0
232,46,Mod done modern,"I found this dress on a pretty good sale. i'd never pay full price. that said, it's very stylish. it reminds me of marni, mui mui or prada. as other posters have mentioned, it does run tight across the bust",0
232,46,Needs pockets! runs large,"Even though this is an online exclusive, i was able to try on a one off in the store. i have been looking for a cross front dress and the other option currently at retailer (the black and white striped top version) in a similar length) looked awkward. this dress looks great on but i needed the xs. i usually wear a 2. it was cute and i came online to see if the xs was available but it is sold out. the dress would be perfect if it had pockets!",1
232,48,"Love, love, love!","This adorable dress has surpassed my expectations! i ordered an xs and s and am keeping the xs. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34c, and the xs fits like a dream. it's not sack-like at all. the top is fitted, and the bottom flairs very flatteringly. the bell sleeves aren't too long like some i've seen. the color and print are the epitome of fall! the length is perfect; it's long enough for work but short and flirty enough for evenings out. i can imagine wearing with heels or booties.",4
232,49,Best foot forward,"I was recently asked to be a speaker at an important fundraising event for homeless & abused women in our city. i wanted to appeal to the affluent crowd by my physical presentation, and let my words follow with a heartfelt presentation of the value & worth of these precious ladies.

232,49,Color,"This is a classic pencil dress that would be becoming on most straight figures. i always wear a 6 (or medium) in hd, and this dress is a little large everywhere. i love it so much, i paid full price and i will probably have it taken in on the sides if possible. the lacework is gorgeous and sturdy - it doesn't catch on stuff. there is a lot of give to sit and move in, unlike most pencil dresses, and i cannot say enough about the color. wow, heads turn when you walk into a room in this gorgeous de",0
232,49,Cozy winter party dress,"I bought this shift dress for a ""black & plaid"" nye event, and it fit the bill perfectly for a cold winter's night. looks great with tights and boots, has pockets, and dresses up nicely. i like a good shift at this point in the holiday season -- leaves room for that last bit of seasonal eating and drinking. looking forward to wearing this through the winter months.",1
232,49,"Great style, poor quality","I wanted this dress so much, i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up, at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on, and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced, but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad, as it seems like it would be a nice",5

232,50,Material was fuzzy and itchy,"I got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy. the prior reviews stated it was ""warm and cozy"" and not itchy at all, but i found it to be uncomfortably so. the dress was true to size for me and the length was good. i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough. the material reminded me of mohair.",0
232,50,Too short shorter than written tunic not dress,"Dress is nice but can't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30"" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i'm only 5'1 and it was too short . can't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !",5
232,51,Poor fit,"This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body, maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately, i had to return it.",0

232,63,Love this dress!,This dress is absolutely darling! it is light as a feather and floats on the body. the fabric looks almost handpainted and fits like a dream. i disagree with the previous poster and i think it looks very rich. super comfortable and i know i'll get lots of wear out of it. you can dress it up or dress it down. love it!,2
